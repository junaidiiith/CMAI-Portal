Consequently, many different solutions have been developed. [Question/problem] We observed a lack of common benchmarks, in particular for the IoT domain to evaluate and compare solutions. There are very few accessible cases (examples) for SCSs published at all. [Principal ideas/results] We propose a case from the IoT domain, smart cities in particular, which comprises of hardware and software components. Starting point is a smart street lighting system with communication between the lamps and passing cars. [Contribution] First, in this paper we present our initial results of running a case study with a model-based prototyping framework on the smart street light. The framework includes a software simulation of the street lamp and the events from the passing cars. Second, an engineer can use the case as a benchmark to compare several approaches in order to make a more informed decision which approach to choose.","['Germany', 'Germany']","['Dortmund University of Applied Sciences', 'Dortmund University of Applied Sciences']"

However, the goal-oriented requirements modeling is not an easy way for novice requirements engineers. These professionals need more support in creating KAOS models. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g., Natural Language Processing – NLP) to support Requirements Engineering activities. In this sense, this paper aims to describe a way to support requirements elicitation for novice requirements engineers through the use of NLP within a chatbot. The chatbot (KAOSbot) acts as a KAOS modeling assistant. To evaluate our hypotheses about perceived efficacy from the novice requirements engineers perspective, we performed a quasi-experiment concerning KAOSbot’s perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. The results show that KAOSbot tool is a promising approach for specifying KAOS models because it was perceived as easy to use, useful, and the participants intend to use it in the future.","['Brazil', 'Brazil', 'Portugal', 'Brazil']","['Catholic University of Pernambuco', 'Catholic University of Pernambuco', 'NOVA University of Lisbon', 'Catholic University of Pernambuco']"

Therefore, we propose a mechanism to unify the back-end in the tool yet showing linkable ORM, UML, and ER diagrams in the interface. This is achieved by taking a two-pronged approach: 1) supporting full expressiveness of these languages and relying on a unifying metamodel, and 2) a logics back-end for their evidence-driven profiles in DL. Both have a set of rules for inter-model assertions. These profiles are tractable. As a result, we propose an architectural design for a tool that would help to integrate heterogeneous conceptual models and link them with ontologies, based on clear semantic specifications and with tractable algorithms.","['Argentina', 'Argentina', 'South Africa']","['South National University', 'Comision de Investigaciones Cientificas - La Plata', 'University of Cape Town']"

This paper presents a domain-specific visual language specifically developed for modeling metacognition in intelligent systems called M++. In M++ the specifications of the cognitive level (object-level) and metacognitive level (meta-level) are supported in a metamodel configured according to the standard Meta-Object Facility (MOF) of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) methodology. M++ allows the generation of metacognitive diagrams in a visual editor named MetaThink. A validation process was conducted to ensure the reliability of M++ in terms of quality of the notation and consistency of generated models. The validation was performed using two techniques: (i) empirical study and (ii) model tracing. The results given in the experimental study demonstrate that M++ is a useful notation for the process of modeling metacognitive components in intelligent systems. Metacognitive models generated from the validation process using the Tracing technique were consistent with the MOF-based metamodel. M++ contribute to cognitive architecture research adding precision to metacognitive concepts and enabling cognitive architecture researchers to do fast and exploratory prototyping of metacognitive systems using MetaThink tool.,"['Colombia', 'United States', 'Colombia', 'United Kingdom']","['Córdoba, Monteria, Universidad de', 'Bowie State University', 'National University of Colombia, Medellín Campus', 'The University of Manchester']"

Our focus is the adaptation according to TOPN concepts of cooperation objects for supporting synchronous and asynchronous communications and the temporal fuzzy learning proposed in FTPN. These two diagrams have been chosen because they are the most commonly used in modeling MAS and describing agent learning and reasoning ability.

In contrast to related work, this innovative approach operationalizes reference models as an abstract model that can be transformed in a minimal number of steps towards individual business process models. The formulated optimization problem of minimal graph-edit distance is approximated using a variant of genetic algorithms. The method is applied to relevant real-world examples of individual business process models to evaluate inductive reference model development following evolution strategies.

Current research in knowledge-driven activity modelling has mainly focused on single activities with little attention being paid to the modelling of composite activities such as interleaved and concurrent activities. This paper presents a hybrid approach to composite activity modelling by combining ontological and temporal knowledge modelling formalisms. Ontological modelling constructors, i.e. concepts and properties for describing composite activities, have been developed and temporal modelling operators have been introduced. As such, the resulting approach is able to model both static and dynamic characteristics of activities. Several composite activity models have been created based on the proposed approach. In addition, a set of inference rules has been provided for use in composite activity recognition. A concurrent meal preparation scenario is used to illustrate both the proposed approach and associated reasoning mechanisms for composite activity recognition. © 2012 IEEE.","['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom']","['Ulster University', 'Ulster University', 'Ulster University', 'Ulster University']"

Yet, three major challenges stand out in engineering any business transformation process. The first challenge is accurate modeling of the transformation knowledge that may be scattered across multiple application domains. The second challenge is efficient and precise real-time evaluation based on the knowledge model. The third challenge will be to generate intelligent recommendations about business transformation that can significantly improve the business process and drive down opportunity costs. This paper proposes an integrated knowledge model-driven recommender system that effectively addresses all of the three abovementioned challenges of modeling, evaluating, and recommending. Using a real-world case study on warranty processing at a major automotive manufacturer, this paper presents a novel business transformation framework that consists of a knowledge model on business value drivers and metrics, an evaluation engine for processing real-time business events, and a recommendation engine that utilizes information obtained from the evaluation engine to suggest new processes and workforce allocation strategy, which can be subjected to a new cycle of modeling and evaluation to complete a feedback loop. Our experimental study using the real-world data results in a ""25/75"" rule in predictive warranty data processing: 25% of information contains 75% of business information entropy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the system. © 2006 IEEE.","['United States', 'United States']","['IBM Thomas J.

On a systematic level, three procedures are presented to facilitate the alignment of knowledge between people and technology: the decomposition of concepts from design thinking in conceptual models, the abstraction of capabilities from intelligent environments in conceptual models, and the (semi-) automated, intelligent transformation of conceptual models. Furthermore, the architecture of ICT infrastructure supporting the three procedures is addressed. These systematic foundations are integrated in the OMiLAB ecosystem and instantiated in two projects. The first project revolves around PRINTEPS, which is a framework to develop practical Artificial Intelligence.

There are several methods and models for modelling the learner in adaptive hypermedia educational systems, but they're based on the initial profile of the learner created in his entry into the learning situation. They do not handle the uncertainty in the dynamic modelling of the learner based on the actions of the learner. The main hypothesis of this paper is the management of the learner model based on MEBN and artificial intelligence, taking into accounts the different action that the learner could take during his/her whole learning path. In this paper, the use of the notion of fragments and MEBN theory (MTheory) to lead to a Bayesian multi-entity network has been proposed. The use of this Bayesian method can handle the whole course of a learner as well as all of its shares in an adaptive educational hypermedia. The approach that we followed during this paper is marked initially by modelling the learner model in three levels: we started with the conceptual level of modelling with the unified modelling language, followed by the model based on Bayesian networks to be able to achieve probabilistic modelling in the three phases of learner modelling.","['Morocco', 'Brazil', 'Morocco']","['Abdelmalek Essaâdi University', 'University of Brasilia', 'Abdelmalek Essaâdi University']"

Model refactoring counteracts erosion of the software design at an early stage in the software development project complying with the model-driven engineering paradigm. Traditional model refactoring approaches work at the surface level by using threshold values of model metrics as indicators of suboptimal design and carry out localized corrections. Through this paper, it is proposed that identifying design flaws at a higher level of granularity will save from the vicious cycle of small refactoring operations and their cascaded side-effects. The notion of functional decomposition, as an anomalous design tendency and a dominant cause of design, smells in object-oriented software, is introduced. It is suggested that refactoring operations targeted at signs of functional decomposition instead of atomic smells achieve substantial improvement in design within a concise quality assurance procedure. The idea is realized using a deep neural network that learns to recognize the presence of functional decomposition in UML models of object-oriented software. The presented approach uses data science methods to gain insight into multidimensional software design features and uses the experience gained to generalize subtle relationships among architectural components.","['India', 'India', 'India']","['Punjabi University', 'Punjabi University', 'Punjabi University']"

Manufacturing engineers, however, often lack the expertise to apply advanced analytics, relying instead on frequent consultations with data scientists. Furthermore, collaborations between manufacturing engineers and data scientists have resulted in highly specialized applications that are not relevant to broader use cases. The manufacturing industry can benefit from the techniques applied in these collaborations if they can be generalized for a wide range of manufacturing problems without requiring a strong knowledge about analytical models. This paper first presents a model-based methodology to help manufacturing engineers who have little or no experience in advanced analytics apply machine learning techniques for manufacturing problems. This methodology includes a meta-model repository and model transformations. The meta-models define concepts and rules that are commonly known in the manufacturing industry in order to facilitate the creation of manufacturing models. The model transformations enable the semi-automatic generation of analytical models using a given manufacturing model. Second, a model-based Tool for ADvanced Analytics in Manufacturing (TADAM) is presented to allow manufacturing engineers to apply the methodology. TADAM offers capabilities to generate neural networks for manufacturing process problems. Using TADAM's graphical user interface, a manufacturing engineer can build a model for a given process to provide: 1) the key performance indicator (KPI) to be predicted, and 2) the variables contributing to this KPI. Once the manufacturing engineer has built the model and provided the associated data, the model transformations available in TADAM can be called to generate a trained neural network. Finally, the benefits of TADAM are demonstrated in a manufacturing use case in which a manufacturing engineer generates a neural network to predict the energy consumption of a milling process.","['France', 'United States', 'United States', 'United Arab Emirates']","['University of Burgundy', 'Maryland, College Park, University of', 'Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy', 'NYU Abu Dhabi']"

AmI proposes the development of context aware systems equipped with devices that can recognize your context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. However, current agent approaches do not adequately fulfill the requirements posed by AmI systems. From a modeling point of view, the aim should be to help in the design by providing adequate tools that assist in the development of important properties of AmI systems, such as context-awareness; and from an implementation point of view, agent technologies must be adapted to the diversity of AmI devices and communication technologies. As a solution to these issues we propose a Model driven engineering process, which supports the automatic generation of agent-based AmI systems. The source metamodel is PIM4Agents, a general purpose agent metamodel that we have adapted to support the explicit modeling of context aware systems, and the target metamodel is Malaca, an aspect-oriented agent architecture. Aspect-orientation makes Malaca platform-neutral for FIPA compliant agent platforms, simplifying the model driven process. The solution generates MalacaTiny agents, an implementation of Malaca that is able to run in AmI devices. We have evaluated the convenience of applying a model driven approach by measuring the degree of automation of our process and we have evaluated MalacaTiny for mobile phones by assessing different parameters, related to the scarcity of resources in AmI systems.

To build such complex systems, instead of writing the code from scratch, one can follow the model-driven development approach, which aims to generate software from design models automatically. To achieve this goal, two important prerequisites are: a domain-specific modeling language for designing an emergency response environment model, and transformation programs for automatic code generation from a model. In addition, for modeling with the language, a modeling tool is required, and for executing the generated code there is a need to a platform. In this paper, a model-driven framework for developing multi-agent systems in emergency response environments is provided which includes several items. A domain-specific modeling language as well as a modeling tool is developed for this domain. The language and the tool are called ERE-ML and ERE-ML Tool, respectively. Using the ERE-ML Tool, a designer can model an emergency response situation and then validate the model against the predefined constraints. Furthermore, several model to code transformations are defined for automatic multi-agent system code generation from an emergency response environment model.

With the advent of Internet of things (IoTs), massive amount of data is being generated from different sources. The centralized architecture of cloud has become inefficient for the services provision to IoT enabled applications. For better support and services, fog layer is introduced in order to manage the IoT applications demands like latency, responsiveness, deadlines, resource availability and access time etc. of the fog nodes. However, there are some issues related to resource management and fog nodes allocation to the requesting application based on user expectations in the fog layer that need to be addressed. In this paper, we have proposed a Framework, based on Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) that practices Machine Learning algorithms and places fog enabled IoT applications at a most suitable fog node. MDSE is meant to develop software by exploiting the problem at domain model level. It is the abstract representation of knowledge that enhances productivity by maximization of compatibility between the systems. The proposed framework is a meta-model that prioritizes the placement requests of applications based on their required expectations and calculates the abilities of the fog nodes for different application placement requests. Rules based machine learning methods are used to create rules based on user’s requirements metrics and then results are optimized to get requesting device placement in the fog layer. At the end, a case study is conducted that uses fuzzy logic for application mapping and shows how the actual application placement will be done by the framework.

Domain modelling is used during requirements analysis or the early stages of design to transform informal requirements written in natural language to domain models which are analyzable and more concise. Since domain modelling is time-consuming and requires modelling skills and experience, many approaches have been proposed to extract domain concepts and relationships automatically using extraction rules. However, relationships and patterns are often hidden in the sentences of a problem description. Automatic recognition of relationships or patterns in those cases requires context information and external knowledge of participating domain concepts, which goes beyond what is possible with extraction rules. In this paper, we draw on recent work on domain model extraction and envision a novel technique where sentence boundaries are customized and clusters of sentences are created for domain concepts. The technique further exploits a BiLSTM neural network model to identify relationships and patterns among domain concepts. We also present a classification strategy for relationships and patterns and use it to instantiate our technique. Preliminary results indicate that this novel idea is promising and warrants further research.","['Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada']","['McGill University', 'McGill University', 'McGill University', 'McGill University']"

In the recommendation systems, user modeling is a crucial step. Whether the model can accurately describe the users' interests directly determines the quality of the personalized recommendations. At present in most personalized service systems keywords models or user-item models are used to describe the users' preferences, but vectors or matrixes used in these models do not contain semantic information, so it is difficult to accurately model the users' interests and hobbies, and it is also hard to extend the users' interests. Ontology as a tool used to describe the domain knowledge is very powerful in conceptual describing and logical reasoning. Computation of the neighbor set of users or resources is also an important step in the recommendation, but at present three commonly used similarity algorithms have some shortcomings which lead the system sometimes difficulty to find similar users or resources. This paper presents a new ontology-based user modeling approach and an improved similarity algorithm. Our experiments show that the user model presented in this paper can effectively describe the users' personalized preferences, and we also prove that the improved similarity algorithm is better than other three commonly used similarity algorithms. © 2010 IEEE.","['China', 'China', 'China']","['Beihang University', 'Beihang University', 'Beihang University']"

These models are used to depict the ontological organization of relevant concepts or entities. Such formalisms share a common modeling approach, based on the notions of class or entity and the relations or associations between classes or entities. Recent developments in knowledge representation using logic-based ontologies have created new possibilities for conceptual data modeling. It also raises the question of how existing conceptual models using ER, UML or ORM could be translated into Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that have proved to be particularly appropriate for formalizing ontologies and reasoning about them. Given a conceptual data model, two assumptions are usually made that are not explicitly stated but need to be clarified for its DL translation: (1) disjointness assumption: all the classes are to be assumed pairwise disjoint if not specified otherwise; and (2) covering assumption: the content of every class must correspond to the union of its immediate subclasses (this includes the assumption that we do not consider anything apart from what is expressed in the model). In this paper we propose two simple procedures to assist modelers with integrating these assumptions into their models, thereby allowing for a more complete translation into DLs.

Therefore, an efficient and accurate development of UI's is desirable in early Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases. To achieve this, Object Management Group (OMG) introduced Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) standard in 2013. IFML provides the modeling of manifold UI's for different applications like mobile, web and desktop. Although IFML is based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principle, the development of user interface models from initial requirements is still complex and time consuming task. Particularly, it requires domain expertise to understand several IFML concepts like domain model, view container etc. for the proper modeling of user interfaces. Consequently, there is a strong need of an approach to automate the development of IFML models from initial plain text requirements. This article presents a novel framework to automatically generate IFML models from textual requirements by utilizing the features of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Particularly, a set of NLP rules are developed to extract important IFML elements like View Components, Events etc. from textual requirements. Furthermore, a comprehensive algorithm is developed for the systematic execution of NLP rules in order to generate both IFML Domain and Core models. As a part of research, a sophisticated $T$ ext to IF ML (T2IF) tool is developed. The feasibility of proposed framework is demonstrated through movie manager and online bookstore case studies. The evaluation results prove that the proposed framework is capable of generating IFML models from textual requirements with high accuracy.","['Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan']","['College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering', 'College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering', 'College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering', 'College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering', 'College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering', 'College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering']"

One of the key issues is to model the SoS requirements and automate the verification procedure. To solve the problem of modeling and verification, meta-models are proposed to refine both functional and non-functional characteristics of the SoS requirements. A domain-specific modeling language is defined by extending Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and association with fuzzy constructs to model the vague and uncertain concepts of the SoS quality requirements. The efficiency evaluation function of the cloud model is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the SoS quality requirements. Then a concise algorithm transforms the fuzzy UML models into the description logic (DL) ontology so that the verification can be automated with a DL reasoner.

However, the development of MASs is not trivial due to the various agent properties such as autonomy, responsiveness, and proactiveness, and the need for realization of the many different agent interactions. To support the development of MASs various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) have been introduced that provide a declarative approach for modeling and supporting the generation of agent-based systems. To be effective, the proposed DSMLs need to meet the various stakeholder concerns and the related quality criteria for the corresponding MASs. Unfortunately, very often the evaluation of the DSML is completely missing or has been carried out in idiosyncratic approach. If the DSMLs are not well defined, then implicitly this will have an impact on the quality of the MASs. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework and systematic approach for assessing existing or newly defined DSMLs for MASs. The evaluation is specific for MAS DSMLs and targets both the language and the corresponding tools. To illustrate the evaluation approach, we first present SEA_ML, which is a model-driven MAS DSML for supporting the modeling and generation of agent-based systems.

However, a weakly hard real-time system integrates both these requirements. The problem with these systems is the limitation of the scheduling analysis method which only uses the traditional scheduling approach. Besides that, the current framework has problems with the complexity and predictability of the systems. This paper proposes a scheduling analysis framework based on, namely: the suitability of scheduling algorithms, the weakly hard real-time modelling and genetic algorithm approach for predicting the weakly hard real-time tasks. Initially, the best fitting specification of a weakly hard real-time system was integrated into the proposed framework and tested in the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems (MARTE) profile. Sequence diagram complexity factor metrics were used to measure the behavioural complexity of the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time (SPT) and MARTE profiles. Further, the genetic algorithm approach was applied on the framework to measure the predictability of the soft real-time tasks. The results of the framework showed that the number of deadlines missed among the tasks was optimized by applying the framework on a case study. In conclusion, the proposed scheduling analysis framework provides a less complex design through the UML design modelling, as well as increasing the predictability of the systems. © SCRG Publication, 2013.","['Malaysia', 'Malaysia']","['Technology Malaysia, University', 'Technology Malaysia, University']"

Learning-based autonomous systems which are called AI are treated as an inherently untrustworthy ‘black box,’ because machine learning or deep learning algorithms are difficult for humans to understand. Robot systems such as assistive robots, which work closely with humans, however, should be trusted. Systems should therefore achieve accountability for all stakeholders. However, most research in this field has focused on particular systems and situations, and no general design architecture exists. In this study, we propose a new design method, focused on accountability and transparency, for learning-based robot systems. Describing the entire system is a necessary first step, and transcribing the described system for each stakeholder based on several principles is effective for achieving accountability. The method improves transparency for systems, including learning algorithms. A standing assistive robot is used as an example of the entire system to clarify which system parts require greater transparency. This study adopted the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to describe the system and the described system is used for the information representation. Information should be represented considering the relationships between stakeholders, information, and the system interface. Because of their complexity, it is difficult for humans to understand the complete set of information available in robot systems. Systems should therefore present only the information required, depending on the situation. The stakeholder–interface relationship is also important because it is more beneficial for professionals to view information relevant to their specialized field, which would be difficult for others to understand. By contrast, the interface should be intuitive for general users. Visualization and sound are very useful means of transmitting information, with advantages and disadvantages for different circumstances. These relationships are important for achieving accountability. Finally, we show an example of implementation with a developed support system. It is confirmed that accountable systems can be designed based on the proposed design architecture.","['Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan']","['Tohoku University', 'Tohoku University', 'Tohoku University', 'RT.WORKS CO., LTD', 'RT.WORKS CO., LTD', 'RT.WORKS CO., LTD']"

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Based on current capabilities, many Machine Learning techniques are often inscrutable and they can be hard for users to trust because they lack effective means of generating explanations for their outputs. There is much research and development investigating this area, with a wide variety of proposed explanation techniques for AI/ML across a variety of data modalities. In this paper we investigate which modality of explanation to choose for a particular user and task, taking into account relevant contextual information such as the time available to them, their level of skill, what level of access they have to the data and sensors in question, and the device that they are using. Additional environmental factors such as available bandwidth, currently usable sensors and services are also able to be accounted for. The explanation techniques that we are investigating range across transparent and post-hoc mechanisms and form part of a conversation with the user in which the explanation (and therefore human understanding of the AI decision) can be ascertained through dialogue with the system. Our research is exploring generic techniques that can be used to underpin useful explanations in a range of modalities in the context of AI/ML services that operate on multisensor data in a distributed, dynamic, contested and adversarial setting. We define a meta-model for representing this information and through a series of examples show how this approach can be used to support conversational explanation across a range of situations, datasets and modalities.","['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom']","['IBM United Kingdom Limited', 'Cardiff University', 'Cardiff University']"

Describing social phenomena with a visual, high-level modeling language and implementing the simulation in this way should facilitate the use of toolkits by experts in social sciences without a deep knowledge of programming concerns. This simulation approach is supported here by the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK), which provides a model editor for multi-agent systems, and code generation support.

To this end, they can behave in a cooperative manner and collaborate with other agents constituting systems called Multi-agent Systems (MAS). These systems have different perspectives such as the internal structure, plan, interaction, organisation, role, environment and so on. By having these views, MASs can consider the structure, behaviour, interaction, and environment of the complex systems such as Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, intelligent software agents and MASs can be used in the modelling and development of CPSs. There are different Domain-specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) to build MASs with a focus on various MAS aspects. One of the generative MAS DSMLs is SEA_ML++ which presents a thorough Model-driven Engineering practice with including the abstract syntax, graphical concrete syntax, model-to-model transformations and model-to-code transformations with the support of Platform Independent and Platform Specific levels of MAS modelling. In this chapter, we discuss how SEA_ML++ is used for the design and implementation of agent-based CPSs. An MDE methodology is introduced in which SEA_ML++ can be used to design agent-based CPS and implement these systems on various agent execution platforms. As the evaluating case study, the development of a multi-agent garbage collection CPS is taken into consideration. The conducted study demonstrates how this CPS can be designed according to the various viewpoints of SEA_ML++ and then implemented and executed on Jason platform.","['Belgium', 'Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Portugal']","['University of Antwerp and Flanders Make', 'International Computer Institute Ege University', 'Dokuz Eylul University', 'University of Lisbon']"

Different kinds of models can be settled to solve different problems, such as physical models, mathematical models, figurai models etc. The main shortcoming of such traditional models is that they treat the members of the system as ones without aims, preferences and activities. Agent technology provides a new idea and methodology for modeling. Agent-based modeling pays more attention to the behavior and the interaction of the individuals in the systems, and the macroscopic characteristics of the system are the interactive result of all the individuals. In this paper, the agent-based modeling method is applied to the urban traffic simulation system. The process of the modeling is discussed, and a prototype of a simulation system is programmed. A reinforcement learning control method is tested on the prototype to verify the effectiveness of the modeling method proposed in this paper.",['China'],['East China University of Science and Technology']

The planning and execution of the actions of the agents that execute collaborative processes are driven by a Petri Net engine embedded in these agents. The role an organization fulfills in a collaborative process is represented by a high-level Petri Net model which is used to drive the behavior of the B2B collaboration agents representing the organization. Moreover, interaction protocols representing collaborative processes are executed by these agents without the need for protocols defined at design-time.

Taking a multi-agent system modeling approach, this paper presents a conceptual platform for discovering dynamic pricing solutions that reflect the varying cost of electricity in the wholesale market as well as the level of demand participation, especially regarding household customers and small and medium sized businesses. At first, an agent-based meta-model representing various concepts, relations, and structure of agents is constructed. Then a domain model can be instantiated based upon the meta-model. Finally, a simulation experiment is developed for use case demonstration and model validation. The simulation is for the supplier to obtain the profit-maximizing demand curve which has such a shape that it follows the spot price curve in inverse ratio. The result suggests that this multi-agent-based construct could contribute to 1) estimating the impacts of various timevarying tariff options on peak-period energy use through simulation, before any experimental pilots can be carried out; 2) modeling the electricity retail market evolving interactions in a systematic manner; 3) inducing innovative simulation configurations.","['Finland', 'Estonia']","['Åbo Akademi University', 'Tallinn University of Technology']"

The approach combines the recognition of single and composite activities into a unified framework. To support composite activity modelling, it combines ontological and temporal knowledge modelling formalisms. In addition, it exploits ontological reasoning for simple activity recognition and qualitative temporal inference to support composite activity recognition.

These challenges invoke the use of model-driven development (MDD) along with the representational state transfer (REST) architecture to develop IoT applications, supporting model generation at different abstraction levels while generating software implementation artifacts for heterogeneous platforms and ensuring loose coupling in complex IoT systems. This article proposes an IoT application development framework, named IADev, which uses attribute-driven design and MDD to address the above-mentioned challenges. This framework is composed of two major steps, including iterative architecture development using attribute-driven design and generating models to guide the transformation using MDD. IADev uses attribute-driven design to transform the requirements into a solution architecture by considering the concerns of all involved stakeholders, and then, MDD metamodels are generated to hierarchically transform the design components into the software artifacts. We evaluate IADev for a smart vehicle scenario in an intelligent transportation system to generate an executable implementation code for a real-world system. The case study experiments proclaim that IADev achieves higher satisfaction of the participants for the IoT application development and service orchestration, as compared to conventional approaches. Finally, we propose an architecture that uses IADev with the Siemens IoT cloud platform for service orchestration in industrial IoT.","['China', 'China', 'Australia', 'South Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'China']","['Nanjing University', 'Nanjing University', 'University of Technology Sydney', 'Kyung Hee University', 'King Saud University', 'Nanjing University']"

In this paper, we present an extensible model repair framework which enables users to deal with different types of models and to add their own repair preferences to customize the results. The framework uses customizable learning algorithms to automatically find the best sequence of actions for repairing a broken model according to the user preferences. As an example, we customize the framework by including as a preference a model distance metric, which allows the user to choose a more or less conservative repair. Then, we evaluate how this preference extension affects the results of the repair by comparing different distance metric calculations. Our experiment proves that extending the framework makes it more precise and produces models with better quality characteristics.","['Norway', 'Norway', 'Italy', 'Norway', 'Norway']","['Western Norway University of Applied Science', 'Western Norway University of Applied Science', 'INFN-Gran Sasso National Laboratory', 'Western Norway University of Applied Science', 'Western Norway University of Applied Science']"

Its study, as it happens with other complex phenomena, has found in simulation a basic tool. However, the use of simulations faces important limitations. Building them requires considering different aspects of traffic (e.g. urbanism, car features, and individual drivers) with their specific theories, that must be integrated to provide a coherent model. There is also a variety of simulation platforms with different requirements. Many of these problems demand multidisciplinary teams, where the different backgrounds can hinder the communication and validation of simulations. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) of simulations has been proposed in other fields to address these issues. Such approaches develop graphical Modelling Languages (MLs) that researchers use to model their problems, and then semi-automatically generate simulations from those models. Working in this way promotes communication, platform independence, incremental development, and reutilisation. This paper presents the first steps for a MDE framework for traffic simulations. It introduces a tailored extensible ML for domain experts. The ML is focused on human actions, so it adopts an Agent-Based Modelling perspective. Regarding traffic aspects, it includes concepts commonly found in related literature following the Driver-Vehicle-Environment model. The language is also suitable to accommodate additional theories using its extension mechanisms. The approach is supported by an infrastructure developed using Eclipse MDE projects: the ML is specified with Ecore, and a model editor and a code generator tools are provided. A case study illustrates how to develop a simulation based on a driver's behaviour theory for a specific target platform using these elements.","['Spain', 'Spain']","['Complutense University of Madrid', 'Complutense University of Madrid']"

Different degree of difficulty is associated with each sequence of assembly operation and such difficulties are caused by the different mechanical constraints forced by the different sequences of operations. In the past, few notable attempts have been made to represent and enumerate the degree of difficulty associated with an assembly sequence (in the form of triangular fuzzy number) by using the concept of assembly graph. However, such representation schemes do not possess the capabilities to model the user's reasoning and preferences. In this research, an intelligent Petri net model that combines the abilities of modelling, planning and performance evaluation for assembly operation is presented. This modelling tool can represent the issues concerning degree of difficulty associated with assembly sequences.

Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues: there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code; their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compare works that use different models and tools. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven development of these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language that supports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS: people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network of sensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed that operates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generate specifications compliant with that language, and a code generator to produce code from them using platform specifications. There are also guidelines to help researchers in the application of this infrastructure.

These architectures employ configurations of both simulation software and machine learning software and thus require skillsets in both areas. In order to further facilitate the combined use of these approaches this article presents a sixth option for a software architecture that uses a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DES software to implement both the simulation and machine learning algorithms. A study is presented of this approach that incorporates the use of a type of ML termed reinforcement learning (RL) which in this example determines an approximate best route for a robot in a factory moving from one physical location to another whilst avoiding fixed barriers.

For the acquisition of highly structured, domainspecific knowledge, machine learning techniques still fall short, and knowledge elicitation and modelling is then the standard. However, obtaining formal models from informants who have few or no formal skills is a non-trivial aspect of knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as an instance of the well-known ""knowledge acquisition bottleneck"". In addition, if there are social requirements on knowledge representations, e.g. constructive agreement on concepts and propositions, this poses a further challenge. Based on our work in conceptual modelling and method engineering, we propose to cast methods for knowledge modelling in the framework of games.

The business process management approach is commonly used to design cross-organizational collaborations. This type of business process aims at achieving specific collaborative objectives by addressing three main steps according to a top-down approach: (i) defining the business services that have to be performed to reach the objectives, (ii) finding the best set of partners to provide them and (iii) ordering the business services in an optimized way. While the resulting business processes are a cornerstone to support the interoperability among the partners of a collaboration, their design step remains often humanly-conducted and laborious. Moreover, seeking the “best” set of partners involves non-additive criteria such as the delivery time (i.e. business services can be performed in sequence or in parallel within the process).

One of the obstacles that may limit the adaptation of new metamodels by developers is the extensive manual changes that have been applied to migrate existing models. Recent studies addressed the problem of automating the metamodel/model co-evolution based on manually defined migration rules. The definition of these rules requires the list of changes at the metamodel level which are difficult to fully identify. Furthermore, different possible alternatives may be available to translate a metamodel change to a model change. Thus, it is hard to generalize these co-evolution rules. Objective: We propose an alternative automated approach for the metamodel/model co-evolution. The proposed approach refines an initial model instantiated from the previous metamodel version to make it as conformant as possible to the new metamodel version by finding the best compromise between three objectives, namely minimizing (i) the non-conformities with new metamodel version, (ii) the changes to existing models, and (iii) the textual and structural dissimilarities between the initial and revised models. Method: We formulated the metamodel/model co-evolution as a multi-objective optimization problem to handle the different conflicting objectives using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Results: We evaluated our approach on several evolution scenarios extracted from different widely used metamodels. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach with average manual correctness, precision and recall respectively higher than 91%, 88% and 89% on the different co-evolution scenarios. Conclusion: A comparison with our previous work confirms the out-performance of our multi-objective formulation.","['Canada', 'Canada', 'Austria']","['University of Montreal', 'University of Montreal', 'Vienna University of Technology']"

Identifying and locating these capabilities are important to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve the overall goal of the SoS. System elements and capabilities in SoS however, are rarely stable and need to evolve in different ways and different times in accordance with the changing requirements. To manage the SoS and cope with its evolution it is necessary that the dependency links to the capabilities and the system elements can be easily traced. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability and reason about these by extending a predetermined set of possible trace links with fixed semantics. However, for the context of SoS a fixed traceability model with fixed traceability semantics is limited to consider the various different and changing scenarios. In this article, we first present the different traceability requirements for managing traceability in the context of SoS. Subsequently, we present the metamodel and the corresponding domain specific language to support modeling traceability and traceability analysis approaches within the evolving SoS context. Further, we provide the tool support for automated reasoning of traceability of SoS capabilities and system elements.

The tool receives a bitmap file (in different formats) as an input and communicates whether the image corresponds to a diagram. For pragmatic reasons, we restricted ourselves to the simplest kinds of diagrams that are more useful for automated software reuse: computer-edited 2D representations of static diagrams. The tool does not require that the images are explicitly or implicitly tagged as UML diagrams. The tool extracts graphical characteristics from each image (such as grayscale histogram, color histogram and elementary geometric forms) and uses a combination of rules to classify it. The rules are obtained with machine learning techniques (rule induction) from a sample of 19,000 web images manually classified by experts. In this work, we do not consider the textual contents of the images. Our tool reaches nearly 95% of agreement with manually classified instances, improving the effectiveness of related research works.

They are an important part of many evaluations. Currently, computer aided assessments are widely used for multiple choice questions, however, they do not have the ability to evaluate a student's knowledge more comprehensively, going beyond right or wrong, which is necessary for the job with the diagram. This research project presents an innovative approach for automatic evaluation of ERD. This approach proposes a solution to the challenge of encouraging students to perfect their solution: seeking, in addition to a response that returns the correct result, a note that approaches the ideal solution. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the student receives instant feedback during the practical diagramming activity, which allows the student to redo his solution for an optimal solution; (2) complete integration of ERD teaching concepts with examples of online diagrams; (3) monitoring the student's activities, i.e. how many examples were executed in each exercise, how many attempts were made. This research is a first step in building a fully assisted environment, for example, with automatic evaluation for ERD teaching, where the professor is freed from the arduous work of correcting diagrams and can perform more relevant pedagogical tasks. The method, based on machine learning techniques, uses structured query language (SQL) metrics extracted from the ERD and experts grade to create the prediction model. The solution can be adapted to other types of diagrams, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).","['Portugal', 'Portugal']","['Coimbra, Centre for Informatics and System, University of', 'Coimbra, Centre for Informatics and System, University of']"

However, if a generated path is infeasible due to internal variables then the transition will not be executed according to the input sequence, resulting in a test failure. Thus, feasible transition paths (FTPs) must be generated to run transition coverage tests. Objective Several automatic transition path generation studies have been conducted using genetic algorithms (GAs), but when generating a transition path using a GA, the dependent transition pairs serve as distractions. Furthermore, counter problems that require repeated execution of dependent transitions (for example, to test a failing operation of an automatic teller machine, the password must be incorrect three times) make FTP generation more difficult. Method In this study, to address these issues, an automatic FTP generation method using a grouping GA (GGA) is described. Considering the characteristics of the problem, modification of the original GGA is proposed. A chromosome initialized using information from the state chart, and generating transition coverage, satisfied FTP while adjusting the length of the chromosome. Results An experiment using the ‘inres initiator’ state chart and the ‘ATM’ state chart generated FTPs successfully. In the case of the inres initiator state chart, the proposed GGA was shown to be capable of generating FTPs with a 100% success rate. In the case of the ATM state chart, the proposed GGA was shown to be capable of generating FTPs with a 100% success rate, by setting the maximum number of generations. Conclusion The proposed GGA can be applied effectively to transition coverage testing using UML state charts, and can generate test paths suitable for testing purposes by setting the genetic parameter value and the maximum number of generations.","['South Korea', 'South Korea']","['Hanyang University', 'Hanyang University']"

To this end, we propose BESMER, our project that categorizes bad smells in systems models by mining discussion forum posts of end-users of a specific systems modeling tool. Specifically, this paper describes how our three-level discovery mechanism based on machine learning techniques assisted us in finding bad smells from the LabVIEW online discussion forum. Our experimental results not only confirm that end-users also encounter the bad smells proposed by experts, but also reveal new bad smells for LabVIEW models. We also present some implications discovered from the examination of user posts and list areas of future work based on our current findings.

However, complex data analytics-based software development is challenging. It involves many new roles lacking in traditional software engineering teams – e.g. data scientists and data engineers; use of sophisticated machine learning (ML) approaches replacing many programming tasks; uncertainty inherent in the models; as well as interfacing with models to fulfill software functionalities. These challenges make communication and collaboration within the team and with external stakeholders challenging. In this paper, we describe our experiences in applying our BiDaML (Big Data Analytics Modeling Languages) approach to several large-scale industrial projects.

An ideal domain specific agent modeling language would be tailored to a certain application domain (e.g. virtual worlds) as well as to the target execution environment (e.g. a legacy virtual reality platform). This includes the use of specialized domain concepts, information models, software languages (e.g. query languages for reasoning about an agent's knowledge), as well as custom views and diagrams for designing the system. At the same time it is desirable to reuse application domain independent model artifacts such as interaction protocols (e.g. auction protocols) or goal/plan decompositions of a certain problem domain that already proved their use in similar scenarios. Current agent modeling languages cover the core concepts of multiagent systems but are neither thought to be customized for a certain application domain nor to be extended by external researchers with new or alternative AI and agent concepts. In this paper we propose a model-driven framework for engineering multiagent systems, called BOCHICA, which is based on a platform independent core modeling language and can be tailored through several extension interfaces to the user's needs. The framework leverages the reuse of existing design patterns and reduces development time and costs for creating application domain specific modeling solutions.

It consists of three complementary modeling views: business view, analytics design view, and data preparation view. These views are linked together to connect enterprise strategies to analytics algorithms and to data preparation activities. The framework includes a set of design catalogues that codify and represent an organized body of business analytics design knowledge. As the first attempt to validate the framework, three real-world data analytics case studies are used to illustrate the expressiveness and usability of the framework.

CM-Builder uses robust Natural Language Processing techniques to analyse software requirements texts written in English and constructs, either automatically or interactively with an analyst, an initial UML Class Model representing the object classes mentioned in the text and the relationships among them. The initial model can be directly input to a graphical CASE tool for further refinement by a human analyst.

Fast advancement of technology has recently generated increased interest for previously non-feasible approaches for providing feedback based on learning behavioral observations by exploiting different traces of learning processes stored in information systems. Such learner behavior data makes it possible to observe different aspects of learning processes in which feedback needs of learners (e.g. difficulties, engagement issues, inefficient learning processes, etc.) based on individual learning trajectories can be traced. By identifying problems earlier in a learning process it is possible to deliver individualized feedback helping learners to take control of their own learning, i.e. to become self-regulated learners, and teachers to understand individual feedback needs and/or adapt their teaching strategies. In this work we (i) propose cognitive computer-assisted feedback mechanisms using a combination of MDE based simulation augmented with automated feedback, and (ii) discuss perspectives for behavioral feedback, i.e. feedforward, that can be based on learning process analytics in the context of learning conceptual modeling. Aggregated results of our previous studies assessing the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive feedback method with respect to improved understanding on different dimensions of knowledge, as well as feasibility of behavioral feedforward automation based on learners behavior patterns, are presented.

Existing work in the area proposes summarization and legal entity extraction from similar past incidents with the interpretation left to the respective parties. In contrast, we present an approach that correlates the facts of the cases, the verdicts, and the reasons behind those verdicts in the form of easily consumable insights. We propose to use two conceptual models first representing a meta model of legal case insights common across various legal domains and the second, a set of conceptual models of a specific legal domain under consideration. We use these models to inform case categorization and user profiling. Then, using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we extract profile specific insights across related available past cases. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using examples from two disparate legal domains, parental alienation cases and divorce cases with promising results, including how such insights can aid decision-making of the user.","['India', 'India', 'India']","['Tata Consultancy Services India', 'Tata Consultancy Services India', 'Tata Consultancy Services India']"

All rights reserved.A key requirement to today's fast changing economic environment is the ability of organizations to adapt dynamically in an effective and efficient manner. Information and Communication Technologies play a crucially important role in addressing such adaptation requirements. The notion of 'intelligent software' has emerged as a means by which enterprises can respond to changes in a reactive manner but also to explore, in a pro-active manner, possibilities for new business models. The development of such software systems demands analysis, design and implementation paradigms that recognize the need for 'co-development' of these systems with enterprise goals, processes and capabilities. The work presented in this paper is motivated by this need and to this end it proposes a paradigm that recognizes co-development as a knowledge-based activity. The proposed solution is based on a multi-perspective modeling approach that involves (i) modeling key aspects of the enterprise, (ii) reasoning about design choices and (iii) supporting strategic decision-making through simulations. The utility of the approach is demonstrated though a case study in the field of marketing for a start-up company.","['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom']","['Nottingham Trent University', 'Alliance Manchester Business School']"

Usually, the plan is not enacted by those who created it. This results in difficulty for responders in utilizating the plan. Conceptual models have been used to gain a better understanding of disaster plans. Unfortunately, the conceptual modeling grammars used to create these conceptual models focus only on the external view of the responders and how they interact with one another; they do not represent the internal view (e.g., assumptions and reasoning) used in their decision making. Without representing the internal view, responders will not know, for example, whether the objective assumed by planners is appropriate for their specific situation. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by utilizing constructs from the intelligent agent literature since they can represent roles, interactions, assumptions, and decision-making. To understand the practicality and usefulness of conceptually representing both external and internal views of different roles in a disaster plan, we performed a case study on the role in the disaster plan of a local Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). The results of the case study show that conceptual modeling using agent constructs has great potential for aiding disaster responders in understanding disaster plans. Because of the model, the assumptions that were hidden in the plan can now be extracted and shown to disaster responders and the efficacy of a plan can be evaluated before it needs to be enacted. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","['Canada', 'Canada']","['UBC Sauder School of Business', 'UBC Sauder School of Business']"

The conceptual model cannot be complete unless Non-Functional Requirements are included. This problem has motivated us to consider both functional and Non Functional Requirements in this research for the development of a conceptual model. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for the development of conceptual model by designing a classifier which segregates the functional and Non Functional Requirements (NFR) from the requirements automatically. Later, these requirements are transformed to the conceptual model with explicit visualization of NFR using design rules. In addition, the results of this model are also validated against the standard models.","['India', 'India', 'India', 'India']","['Anna University', 'Anna University', 'Anna University', 'Anna University']"

It is then used to create a three-layer architecture consisting of the actual data source schemas, a 'wrapped' object-oriented abstraction of the schemas expressed in terms of the thesaurus primitives, and an integrated version which serves as the federation schema. The sharing of information among constituents is also addressed, and a special export schema-the export data/knowledge/task schema-is proposed that ties together the objects, their constraints, and their usage rules. Knowledge sharing among constituents during cooperative query processing is accomplished using data/knowledge packets.","['United States', 'United States']","['George Mason University', 'Global InfoTek, Inc.']"

Building tailored dashboards for any potential user profile would involve several resources and long development times, taking into account that dashboards can be framed in very different contexts that should be studied during the design processes to provide practical tools. This situation leads to the necessity of searching for methodologies that could accelerate these processes. The software product line paradigm is one recurrent method that can decrease the time-to-market of products by reusing generic core assets that can be tuned or configured to meet specific requirements. However, although this paradigm can solve issues regarding development times, the configuration of the dashboard is still a complex challenge; users’ goals, datasets, and context must be thoroughly studied to obtain a dashboard that fulfills the users’ necessities and that fosters insight delivery. This paper outlines the benefits and a potential approach to automatically configuring information dashboards by leveraging domain commonalities and code templates. The main goal is to test the functionality of a workflow that can connect external algorithms, such as artificial intelligence algorithms, to infer dashboard features and feed a generator based on the software product line paradigm.","['Spain', 'Spain', 'Spain', 'Spain', 'Spain', 'Spain']","['University of Salamanca', 'University of Salamanca', 'University of Salamanca', 'University of Salamanca', 'Ramon Llull University', 'Ramon Llull University']"

The expressive and representational power of Petri Nets renders them ideally suited to the modelling of many complex event systems. As a modelling language, they directly support the intrinsically difficult concepts of concurrent and parallel activities, synchronisation of events, and the distribution of various resources. However, the development of a model of a significant system is laborious, and circumstances of limited knowledge of the system's internal structure compound the difficulty. By composing the perceived stimuli and responses of the system under study as a set of behavioural requirements, the Petri Net construction problem can be examined. The inherently difficult nature of this problem renders most other approaches inapplicable or inadequate; the quest for a satisfactory solution leads instead to the development of an algorithm employing genetic search technology. Built around a genetics-based machine learning architecture, the first algorithm developed shows a deficiency in its dependence on the particular order in which various options are explored.

However, classical ontology construction approaches are not sufficient for handling imprecise and uncertain information that is commonly found in many application domains. Therefore, great efforts on construction of fuzzy ontologies have been made in recent years. In this paper, we propose a formal approach and develop an automated tool for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models. Firstly, we propose formalization methods of fuzzy UML models and fuzzy ontologies, where fuzzy UML models and fuzzy ontologies can be represented and interpreted by their respective formal definitions and semantic interpretation methods. Then, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models, i.e., transforming fuzzy UML models (including the structure and instance information of fuzzy UML models) into fuzzy ontologies. Furthermore, following the proposed approach, we implement a prototype transformation tool called FUML2FOnto that can construct fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models. Constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models will facilitate the development of Web ontologies. Moreover, in order to show that the constructed fuzzy ontologies may be useful for reasoning on fuzzy UML models, we investigate how to reason on fuzzy UML models based on the constructed fuzzy ontologies, and it turns out that the reasoning tasks of fuzzy UML models can be checked by means of the reasoning mechanism of fuzzy ontologies. © 2013 Copyright the authors.","['China', 'China']","['Northeastern University', 'Northeastern University']"

For reuse of existing deep learning codes, it introduces a method that imports such a program code, extracts the deep learning model architecture, and transforms it into a graphical representation that can be modified on a graphical interface. Meanwhile, a deep learning model with many layers is difficult to be visualized on a small display screen. To handle the difficulty, it proposes a method to identify the submodules called articulable subgraphs in a deep learning model and to organize the deep learning model into a hierarchical architecture using the nesting relationships of articulable subgraphs. It introduces a method to identify frequent substractures as well as articulable subgraphs as building blocks for deep learning models for levelwise views. The hierarchical representation easily enables to build deep learning models with many layers.

The internal agent behavior and the interaction within the agent organizations become even more complex and hard to implement when the requirements and interactions for the other agent environments such as the Semantic Web are considered.

A conceptual model for AI (Artificial Intelligence) planning is also proposed that works based on RDF and SPARQL. An AI planning algorithm was implemented based on the proposed conceptual model to compose semantic OWSs.

Based on the declarative rules and the integration with the PROLOG-based deductive database system DDBASE, multiple rules acquired in practical case studies can be combined, compared, graphically analysed by domain-experts, and evaluated, resulting in an extensible system for expert knowledge. As a result, the actual modeling DSL becomes executable; the declarative forward-chaining evaluation of deductive databases can be understood by the domain experts.

Since the practice of domain modelling requires time in addition to modelling skills and experience, several approaches have been proposed to automate or semi-automate the construction of domain models from problem descriptions expressed in NL. Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, some significant challenges remain unaddressed: (i) the extracted domain models are not accurate enough to be used directly or with minor modifications in software development, (ii) existing approaches do not facilitate the tracing of the rationale behind the modelling decisions taken by the model extractor, and (iii) existing approaches do not provide interactive interfaces to update the extracted domain models. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a domain modelling bot called DoMoBOT, explain its architecture, and implement it in the form of a web-based prototype tool. The bot automatically extracts a domain model from a problem description written in NL with an accuracy higher than existing approaches. Furthermore, the bot enables modellers to update a part of the extracted domain model and in response the bot re-configures the other parts of the domain model pro-actively. To improve the accuracy of extracted domain models, we combine the techniques of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the extracted domain models.","['Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada']","['McGill University', 'McGill University', 'McGill University', 'McGill University']"

Existing configuration methods in artificial intelligence typically perform quite well in certain subareas but are hard to use for general-purpose modeling without mathematical or logics background (the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck) and/or have scalability issues. As a remedy to this important issue both in theory and in practical applications, we use a standard modeling environment like the Unified Modeling Language that has been proposed by the configuration community as a suitable object-oriented formalism for configuration problems. We provide a translation of key concepts of class diagrams to inequalities and identify relevant configuration aspects and show how they are treated as an integer linear program. Solving an integer linear program can be done efficiently, and integer linear programming scales well to large configurations consisting of several thousands components and interactions. We conduct an empirical study in the context of package management for operating systems and for the Linux kernel configuration. We evaluate our methodology by a benchmark and obtain convincing results in support for using integer linear programming for configuration applications of realistic size and complexity.

These applications are generally agent-centered multi-agent systems (ACMAS). Interaction between ACMAS agents is designed around the internal mental states of an agent and the relationship between these states and its overall behavior. Communication in this approach comprises speech acts whose meaning can be described in terms of the mental states of an agent. This interaction protocol makes it difficult for agents that have been implemented using different approaches to communicate. This paper reviews the potential for addressing this limitation through using organization-centered multi-agent systems (OCMAS) in which agent interaction is designed around macro-level concepts such as organizations, groups, communities, and roles. Although the use of organizational metaphors in agent-based application is still in its infancy, there are some emerging modeling tools that can be used to advance the existing agent-based applications into open MASs that exhibit the dynamic and flexible characteristics of open, distributed systems.

Environment programming accounts for conceiving the computational environment where agents are situated as a first-class abstraction for programming MAS, namely a part of the system that can be designed and programmed-aside to agents-to encapsulate functionalities that will be exploited by agents at runtime. From a programming and software engineering perspective, this is meant to improve the modularity, extensibility and reusability of the MAS as a software system. By adopting the A&A meta-model, we consider environments populated by a dynamic set of computational entities called artifacts, collected in workspaces. From the agent viewpoint, artifacts are first-class entities of their environment, representing resources and tools that they can dynamically instantiate, share and use to support individual and collective activities. From the MAS programmer viewpoint, artifacts are a first-class abstraction to shape and program functional environments that agents will exploit at runtime, including functionalities that concern agent interaction, coordination, organisation, and the interaction with the external environment.

Hence detection of intra-model design inconsistencies is significant in the development of quality software. Objective: The existing approaches of detecting class attribute inconsistencies rely on human decision making. Manual detection of inconsistencies is exhaustive, time consuming and sometimes incomplete. Therefore, we propose an automated and novel approach to perform consistency check of class attributes using artificial intelligence. Method: Inconsistency in attribute definition and specification is detected and fixed with self regulating particle swarm optimization (SRPSO) algorithm that uses a fitness function to optimize the consistency of attributes in class diagram and activity diagrams. SRPSO is preferred since the best particle is not influenced by its or others experience and uses its direction as the best direction and the remaining particles use self and social knowledge to update their velocity and position. Result: The use of artificial intelligence technique for detection and fixing of inconsistencies during the software design phase ensures design completeness through generation of models with consistent attribute definitions and a significant improvement in software quality prediction, accurate code generation, meeting time deadlines, and software production and maintenance cost is achieved. Conclusion: Ensuring consistency and completeness of models is an inevitable aspect in software design and development. The proposed approach automates the process of inconsistency detection and correction in class attribute definition and specification using SRPSO algorithm during the design phase of software development.","['India', 'India']","['Cochin University of Science and Technology', 'Cochin University of Science and Technology']"

However, automated generation of UML class diagrams is a challenging task as it involves lot of pre-processing or manual intervention at times. In this paper, we present dependency analysis based approach to derive UML class diagrams automatically from Natural Language requirements. We transform the requirements statements to an intermediary frame-based structured representation using dependency analysis of requirements statements and the Grammatical Knowledge Patterns. The knowledge stored in the frame-based structured representation is used to derive class diagrams using rule-based algorithm.

First, it is cast as a purely data-driven predictive task. Second, it typically relies on a mapping of dataset characteristics to some measure of generalization performance (e. g., error). Third, it tends to ignore the role of algorithm parameters by relying mostly on default settings. This paper describes a case-based system for model selection which combines knowledge and data in selecting a (set of) algorithm(s) to recommend for a given task. The knowledge consists mainly of the similarity measures used to retrieve records of past learning experiences as well as profiles of learning algorithms incorporated into the conceptual meta-model. In addition to the usual dataset characteristics and error rates, the case base includes objects describing the evaluation strategy and the learner parameters used. These have two major roles: they ensure valid and meaningful comparisons between independently reported findings, and they facilitate replication of past experiments. Finally, the case-based meta-learner can be used not only as a predictive tool but also as an exploratory tool for gaining further insight into previously tested algorithms and datasets.","['Switzerland', 'Switzerland']","['University of Geneva', 'University of Geneva']"

To increase chances of adoption in industrial contexts, software systems can be modeled using well-established standards such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Given that test data generation is one of the major challenges to automate MBT, we focus on test data generation from OCL constraints in this paper. This endeavor is all the more challenging given the numerous OCL constructs and operations that are designed to facilitate the definition of constraints. Though search-based software testing has been applied to test data generation for white-box testing (e.g., branch coverage), its application to the MBT of industrial software systems has been limited. In this paper, we propose a set of search heuristics targeted to OCL constraints to guide test data generation and automate MBT in industrial applications. We evaluate these heuristics for three search algorithms: Genetic Algorithm, (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and Alternating Variable Method. We empirically evaluate our heuristics using complex artificial problems, followed by empirical analyses of the feasibility of our approach on one industrial system in the context of robustness testing. Our approach is also compared with the most widely referenced OCL solver (UMLtoCSP) in the literature and shows to be significantly more efficient. © 2013 IEEE.","['Norway', 'Pakistan', 'Norway', 'Luxembourg']","['Simula Research Laboratory', 'National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Islamabad', 'Simula Research Laboratory', 'University of Luxembourg']"

A test case generation from EFSM needs to satisfy the guard condition before transition from state to state. Testing from EFSM is difficult due to unfeasible paths and test data. This paper proposes a search-based approach to find feasible transition sequences and test data generation. The Unified Modeling Language specifications are translated into extended flow graphs.

By increasing the complexity of application due to the rapid change, automatic evolutionary testing approaches are essential to find solutions providing different trade-offs between testing objectives by applying evolutionary computation. This paper proposes a model-based regression test case generation framework, as an optimization solution, by impressively taking the advantages of the genetic algorithms (GAs), called genetic-based web regression testing (GbWRT). The aim of the paper is twofold. Firstly, a meta-ontology has been designed based on an in-deep assessment to capture testing challenges caused by the inherent dynamic properties of web applications. Secondly, the multi-objective fitness functions of GbWRT are defined built on top of the meta-ontology in terms of the most important meta-model features. GbWRT minimizes exploration and exploitation in regression testing using an incremental change adaption technique implemented in the proposed GA. This approach allows a new incremental regression testing strategy to solve fault detection effectiveness and the coverability problems which are extendable to different domain-specific modeling environments. GbWRT is evaluated using the proposed fitness functions on two experimental case studies. Also, the results of comparison with three non-evolutionary and evolutionary regression testing methods indicate that the GbWRT is competitive with the state of the art regarding solution quality to perform in web-based non-stationary environments.",['Iran'],"['Islamic Azad University, Abadan Branch']"

Relying on a Gibsonian vision of the world to represent, our assumption is that objects naturally give suggestions on how they can be used. From an ontological point of view, this leads to the problem of having different representations of identical objects depending on the context and the involved agents, creating a more realistic multi-diffensional object space to be formally defined. While avoiding to represent purely subjective views, the main issue that needs to be faced is how to manage the highest complexity with the minimum resource requirements. More in detail, we extend the idea of ontologies taking into account the subjectivity of the agents that are involved in the interaction. Instead of duplicating objects, according to the interaction, the ontology changes its aspect, fitting the specific situations that take place. We propose the centerpieces of the idea as well as suggestions of applications that such approach can have in several domains, ranging from Natural Language Processing techniques and Ontology Alignment to User Modeling and Social Networks.","['Italy', 'Italy']","['University of Turin', 'University of Turin']"

Consequently, deriving a series of positively correlated association rules from workflows is essential to identify strong relationships among key business activities. These rules can subsequently, serve as best practices. We have addressed this problem by hybridizing genetic algorithm with association rules. First, we used correlation to replace support-confidence in genetic algorithm to enable dynamic data-driven determination of support and confidence, i.e.; use correlation to optimize the derivation of positively correlated association rules. Second, we used correlation as fitness function to support upward closure in association rules (hitherto, association rules support only downward closure). The ability to support upward closure allows derivation of the most specific association rules (business model) from less specific association rules (business meta-model) and generic association rules (reference meta-model). Downward closure allows the opposite. Upward-downward closures allow the manager to drill-down and analyze based on the degree of dependency among business activities. Subsequently, association rules can be used to describe best practices at the model, meta-model and reference meta-model levels with the most general positively dependent association rules as reference meta-model.

Although requirements modeling techniques provide mechanisms for abstraction and clarity, fostering the reuse of shared functionality (e.g., via UML relationships for use cases), they are seldom employed in practice. A particular quality problem of textual requirements, such as use cases, is that of having duplicate pieces of functionality scattered across the specifications. Duplicate functionality can sometimes improve readability for end users, but hinders development-related tasks such as effort estimation, feature prioritization, and maintenance, among others. Unfortunately, inspecting textual requirements by hand in order to deal with redundant functionality can be an arduous, time-consuming, and error-prone activity for analysts. In this context, we introduce a novel approach called ReqAligner that aids analysts to spot signs of duplication in use cases in an automated fashion. To do so, ReqAligner combines several text processing techniques, such as a use case-aware classifier and a customized algorithm for sequence alignment. Essentially, the classifier converts the use cases into an abstract representation that consists of sequences of semantic actions, and then these sequences are compared pairwise in order to identify action matches, which become possible duplications. We have applied our technique to five real-world specifications, achieving promising results and identifying many sources of duplication in the use cases.","['Argentina', 'Argentina', 'Argentina', 'Argentina', 'Argentina', 'Argentina']","['National University of Buenos Aires Central Province', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas', 'National University of Buenos Aires Central Province', 'Comision de Investigaciones Cientificas - La Plata', 'National University of Buenos Aires Central Province', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas']"

The learning mechanisms employ supervised learning techniques to support the generic reuse tasks of retrieval, adaptation, and integration, and emulate expert behaviors of analogy making and designing by assembly.

As concluded by several empirical studies during the past 10 years, applying MBSE methodology is no more a question and we shall now wonder how to do it rather than if we should. One of the major criticisms of MBSE remains about the available tooling to apply its methodology. Multiple surveys show that the usability of tools and the lack of skills from the user are two key barriers that still slow down the spread of the MBSE approach. In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants.

In many applications, these constraints have to be solved to obtain values satisfying the constraints, for example, in the case of model-based testing (MBT) to generate test data for the purpose of generating executable test cases. In our previous work, we proposed novel heuristics for various OCL constructs to efficiently solve them using search algorithms. These heuristics are enhanced in this paper to further improve the performance of OCL constraint solving.

In the first case study, we evaluated each heuristics using carefully designed artificial problems.

However, usability plays an important role in the productivity, learnability and, ultimately, in the adoption of a MAS DSML by agent developers. Method: In this chapter, we discuss how the principles of The “Physics” of Notations (PoN) can be applied to improve the visual notation of a MAS DSML, called SEA_ML and evaluate the result in terms of usability. Results: The evolved version of the language, SEA_ML++, was perceived as significantly improved in terms of icons comprehensibility, adequacy and usability, as a direct result of employing the principles of PoN.

Service Composition by manual cannot meet the expectations in reality, but the wholly intellectualized automatic service composition is a very complicated process. So, many applications and research about service composition are oriented to semiautomatic service composition, for obtaining optimal performance by some compositing policies. A global constraint is independent if the values that should be assigned to all the remaining restricted attributes can not be uniquely determined once a value is assigned to one. Based on the Web service ontology, the paper presents an independent global constrains-aware Web service composition approach based on semantic. Associate Petri net (APN) modeling methods which can describe multi-attribute multi-constraint relations and associate relationships between component services are proposed. Then, using the properties and reasoning rules of APN, a constraintaware service composition optimization algorithm is presented in order to locate legal firing sequences in APN model, and those corresponding to the legal firing sequences with the biggest trust value are the optimal solutions. Lots of experiments show that this semantic-based method has both lower time consuming and higher success ratio of service composition.

We propose here the use of one of such BPR languages to enter knowledge on the organisation processes to be used by planning tools. Then, planning tools can be used to semi-automatically generate business process models. As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool shamash, where we have exploded its object oriented structure to introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface and, using a translator transform it into predicate logic terms.

Although the usefulness of agents is in having such capabilities, methods and tools for developing them have focused on practical physical representation rather than accurate conceptualizations of these functions. However, intelligent agents should closely mimic aspects of the environment in which they operate. In the physical sciences, a conceptual model of a problem can lead to better theories and explanations about the area. Therefore, we ask, can an intelligent agent conceptual framework, properly defined, be used to model complex interactions in various social science disciplines? The constructs used in the implementation of intelligent agents may not be appropriate at the conceptual level, as they refer to software concepts rather than to application domain concepts. We propose to use a combination of the systems approach and Bunge's ontology as adapted to information systems, to guide us in defining intelligent agent concepts. The systems approach will be used to define the components of the intelligent agents and ontology will be used to understand the configurations and interrelationships between the components. We will then provide a graphical representation of these concepts for modeling purposes. As a proof of concept for the proposed conceptual model, we applied it to a marketing problem and implemented it in an agent-based programming environment. Using the conceptual model, the user was able to quickly visualize the complex interactions of the agents. The use of the conceptual representation even sparked an investigation of previously neglected causal factors which led to a better understanding of the problem. Therefore, our intelligent agent framework can graphically model phenomena in the social sciences. This work also provides a theoretically driven concept of intelligent agent components and a definition of the interrelationships between these concepts.

One approach to scaling up is Object Oriented Bayesian Networks (OOBNs). These provide modellers with the ability to define classes and construct models with a compositional and hierarchical structure, enabling reuse and supporting maintenance. In the OO programming paradigm, a key concept is inheritance, the ability to derive attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes, which enables an even higher level of reusability and scalability. However, inheritance in OOBNs has yet to be fully defined and implemented. Here we present iOOBN, a tool which provides fully defined inheritance for OOBNs. We provide guidance on modelling in iOOBN, describe our prototype implementation with an existing BN software tool, Hugin, and demonstrate its applicability and usefulness via a case study of re-engineering an existing large complex dynamic OOBN.","['Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia']","['Monash University', 'Monash University', 'Monash University', 'Monash University', 'Monash University']"

In this article, we present a novel approach to design and control smart manufacturing systems. The approach is reactive, that is responds to unplanned situations and implements an iterative refinement technique, that is, optimizes itself during runtime to better accommodate production goals. For realizing these advances, we present a model-driven methodology and we provide a prototypical implementation of such a production system. In particular, we employ Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our artificial intelligence environment for automated planning of production processes and combine it with one of the most prominent Industry 4.0 standards for the fundamental production system model: IEC 62264. We show how to plan the assembly of small trucks from available components and how to assign specific production operations to available production resources, including robotic manipulators and transportation system shuttles. Results of the evaluation indicate that the presented approach is feasible and that it is able to significantly strengthen the flexibility of production systems during runtime. Note to Practitioners - Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work, we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.","['Austria', 'Czech Republic', 'Czech Republic', 'Austria', 'Austria', 'Czech Republic', 'Austria', 'Austria']","['Austrian Council for Research and Technology Development', 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'Institute of Information Systems Engineering TU Wien', 'Johannes Kepler University Linz', 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'Montanuniversität Leobe', 'Johannes Kepler University Linz']"

In multiagent systems, sub-problems are solved by autonomous agents that build organizational structures. Each agent internally further decomposes a problem by goal and plan hierarchies. The underlying design of a system reflects an engineers experience with approaching complex problems. It is desirable to reuse patterns and structures that proved their practical use and were validated (e.g. interaction protocols, goal hierarchies, behavior templates, organizational structures, etc.). This improves software quality and reduces development time and costs in the long run. Model-driven software engineering enables the separation of the platform independent design of the system under consideration and the actual implementation for a concrete execution platform. The gap between the different levels of abstraction is closed by model transformations. In this paper we propose a model-driven reverse engineering approach for lifting the underlying design of implemented multiagent systems to a platform independent level. For this purpose we specify conceptual mappings from the platform to our platform independent modeling language. The extracted structures have to be refined (e.g. by using existing platform independent artifacts) and can be re-used as blue print for solving similar problems on similar execution platforms.

Data scientists need to evaluate various learning algorithms and tune their numerous parameters, based on their assumptions and experience, against concrete problems and training data sets. This is a long, tedious, and resource expensive task. Meta-learning is a recent technique to overcome, i.e. automate this problem. It aims at using machine learning itself to automatically learn the most appropriate algorithms and parameters for a machine learning problem. As it turns out, there are many parallels between meta-modelling - in the sense of model-driven engineering - and meta-learning. Both rely on abstractions, the meta data, to model a predefined class of problems and to define the variabilities of the models conforming to this definition. Both are used to define the output and input relationships and then fitting the right models to represent that behaviour. In this paper, we envision how a meta-model for meta-learning can look like. We discuss possible variabilities, for what types of learning it could be appropriate for, how concrete learning models can be generated from it, and how models can be finally selected.

Business processes are increasingly being automated yet are also expected to be agile. Current business process modeling is typically labor-intensive and results in rigid process models. For larger processes it becomes arduous to consider all possible process variations and enactment circumstances. Contemporaneously, in software development microservices have become a popular software architectural style for partitioning business logic into fine-grained services accessible via lightweight protocols which can be rapidly and individually developed by small teams and flexibly (re)deployed. This results in an increasing number of available services and a much more dynamic IT service landscape. Thus, a more dynamic form of modeling, integration, and orchestration of these microservices with business processes is needed. This paper describes agile business process modeling with Microflows, an automatic lightweight declarative approach for the workflow-centric orchestration of semantically-annotated microservices using agent-based clients, graph-based methods, and the lightweight semantic vocabularies JSON-LD and Hydra. A graphical modeling tool supports Microflow modeling and provides dynamic constraint and microservice recommendations via a recommender service using machine learning of domain-categorized Microflows. To be able to utilize existing process model knowledge, a case study shows how Microflow constraints can be automatically extracted from existing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) process files and transformed into flexible Microflow constraints, which can then be used to train the recommendation service. Further, it describes process mining of Microflow execution logs to automatically extract BPMN models and automated recovery for errors occurring during enactment.","['Germany', 'Germany']","['Aalen University of Applied Sciences', 'Aalen University of Applied Sciences']"

Application components exhibit complex dependencies on the configuration of multiple data center network, middle-ware, and related application resources. Applications are also associated with extended life-cycles, migrating from development to testing, staging and production environments, with frequent roll-backs. Maintaining end-to-end data center operational integrity and quality requires careful planning of (1) application deployment design, (2) resource selection, (3) provisioning operation selection, parameterization and ordering, and (4) provisioning operation execution. Current data center management products are focused on workflow-based automation of the deployment processes. Workflows are of limited value because they hard-code many aspects of the process, and are thus sensitive to topology changes. An emerging and promising class of model-based tools is providing new methods for designing detailed deployment topologies based on a set of requirements and constraints. In this paper we describe an approach to bridging the gap between generated ""desired state"" models and the elemental procedural provisioning operations supported by data center resources. In our approach, we represent the current and desired state of the data center using object models. We use AI planning to automatically generate workflows that bring the data center from its current state to the desired state.

We analyzed the effect of factors such as types of splitting, types of predictions, types of designs, and types of annotations on performance of neural networks. The results of neural networks on the test and unseen data showed that RNN with GRU is the most effective neural network architecture.

The use of this intermediate language called Unified Modelling Language for Activity Theory (UML-AT), reduces the number of required mappings.

Refactoring represents an efficient technique to improve the quality of a design while preserving its behavior. Most of existing work on model refactoring relies on declarative rules to detect refactoring opportunities and to apply the appropriate refactorings. However, a complete specification of refactoring opportunities requires a huge number of rules. In this paper, we consider the refactoring mechanism as a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find good refactoring suggestions starting from a small set of refactoring examples applied to similar contexts. Our approach, named model refactoring by example, takes as input an initial model to refactor, a set of structural metrics calculated on both initial model and models in the base of examples, and a base of refactoring examples extracted from different software systems and generates as output a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactoring operations that should maximize as much as possible the structural similarity based on metrics between the initial model and the models in the base of examples. A heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible refactoring solutions. To this end, we used and adapted a genetic algorithm as a global heuristic search.

Thus, more attention is paid to the transformation aspects in model-driven engineering (MDE) along with the growing importance of modeling in software development. However, a major concern in MDE is how to ensure the quality of the model transformation mechanisms. Most of existing work in model transformation has relied on defining languages to express transformation rules. The main goal of existing transformation approaches is to provide rules generating target models, from source models, without errors. However, other important objective is how to minimize the complexity of transformation rules (e.g., the number of rules and number of matching in the same rule) while maximizing the quality of target models. In fact, reducing rule complexity and improving target model quality are important to (1) make rules and target models easy to understand and evolve, (2) find transformation errors easily, and (3) generate optimal target models. In this chapter, we consider the transformation mechanism as a multiobjective problem where the goal is to find the best rules maximizing target model quality and minimizing rule complexity. Our approach starts by randomly generating a set of rules, executing them to generate some target models. Of course, only solutions ensuring full correctness are considered during the optimization process. Then, the quality of the proposed solution (rules) is evaluated by (1) calculating the number of rules and matching metamodels in each rule and (2) assessing the quality of generated target models using a set of quality metrics. To this end, we use the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to automatically generate the best transformation rules satisfying the two conflicting criteria. We report the results of our validation using three different transformation mechanisms. The best solutions provided well-designed target models with a minimal set of rules. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","['United States', 'United States']","['Michigan, Ann Arbor, University of', 'Michigan, Ann Arbor, University of']"

The reduced use of transformations for this purpose is largely due to the high effort required for their development. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an algorithm to generate model transformations by-example. It overcomes two common limitations of these approaches: the generation of many-to-many transformation between arbitrary graphs of elements; dealing with transformation languages that do not directly support graphs of elements in their source or target models. The algorithm has been implemented for the ATLAS transformation language in the MTGenerator tool.

Our approach combines a set of meta-models and transformation rules based on the domain knowledge of manufacturing engineers and data scientists. Our approach uses a model of a manufacturing process and its associated data as inputs, and generates a trained neural network model as an output to predict a quantity of interest. This paper presents the domain-specific knowledge that the approach should employ, the formal workflow of the approach, and a milling process use case to illustrate the proposed approach. We also discuss potential extensions of the approach.","['France', 'United States', 'United States', 'Qatar', 'United States']","['University of Burgundy', 'Maryland, College Park, University of', 'Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy', 'Qatar University', 'National Institute of Standards and Technology']"

The conceptual core of the framework is ontologically-driven. Our ontological approach consists of two elements. The first one is a domain Ontology for Autonomous Systems (OASys) to capture the autonomous system structure, function and behaviour. The second element is an Ontology-driven Engineering Methodology (ODEM) to develop the target autonomous system. This methodology is based on Model-based Systems Engineering and produces models of the system as core assets. These models are used through the whole system life-cycle, from implementation or validation to operation and maintenance. On the application side, the ontological framework has been used to develop a metacontrol engineering technology for autonomous systems, the OM Engineering Process (OMEP), to improve their runtime adaptivity and resilience. OMEP has been applied to a mobile robot in the form of a metacontroller built on top of the robot's control architecture. It exploits a functional model of the robot (TOMASys Model) to reconfigure its control if required by the situation at runtime. The functional model is based on a metamodel about controller function and structure using concepts form the ontology. The metacontroller was developed using the ontology-driven methodology and a robot control reference architecture.","['Spain', 'Netherlands', 'Spain']","['Universidad Politécnica de Madridz', 'Delft University of Technology', 'Universidad Politécnica de Madridz']"

The proposed solution allows for a simple design of the decision support systems and the reduction of time and costs of development. The authors use the inductive logic programming framework to learn these transformation rules from examples of previous projects.

In this paper, agent-oriented software development (AOSD) and MDE paradigms are fully integrated for the development of MAS. Meta-modeling techniques are explicitly used to speed up several phases of the process. The Prometheus methodology is used for the purpose of validating the proposal. The meta-object facility (MOF) architecture is used as a guideline for developing a MAS editor according to the language provided by Prometheus methodology. Firstly, an Ecore meta-model for Prometheus language is developed. Ecore is a powerful tool for designing model-driven architectures (MDA). Next, facilities provided by the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) are used to generate the graphical editor. It offers support to develop agent models conform to the meta-model specified. Afterwards, it is also described how an agent code generator can be developed. In this way, code is automatically generated using as input the model specified with the graphical editor.

Although therapy robots have a strong potential in dealing with therapeutic and other medical applications, they have not been fully utilized in everyday therapy activities due to concerns over safety and the lack of friendly robot user/patient interaction models. From the viewpoint of software engineering, a user-centred design based on UML (Unified Modelling Language) has been known to be one of the best solutions to satisfy usability since the design process relies heavily on the analysis of users and their tasks to reach their goals. Therefore, a model-driven approach to interactive system design via UML for therapy robots is needed to make them usable in the real world. This paper proposes such approach and introduces a new graphical notation that describes user interface elements and the methods of connection with hardware/software objects. With the proposed abstract interaction models, prototyping interactive systems can be made faster and allows for their evaluation by users and system developers before implementation in order to improve usability from the perspectives of users and system developers.","['Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada']","['University of Guelph', 'University of Guelph', 'University of Waterloo']"

This paper states the thesis that when learning agents are applied to work environments that require domain-specific experience, the agent benefits if it can be further adapted by a supervising domain expert. Closely interacting with the agent, a domain expert should be able to understand its decisions and update the underlying knowledge base as needed. The result would be an agent with individualized knowledge that comes in part from the domain experts. The model of such an adaptive learning agent must take into account the problem domain, the design of the learning agent and the perception of the domain user. Therefore, already in the modeling phase, more attention must be paid to make the learning element of the agent adaptable by an operator. Domain modeling and meta-modeling methods could help to make inner processes of the agent more accessible. In addition, the knowledge gained should be made reusable for future agents in similar environments. To begin with, the existing methods for modeling agent systems and the underlying concepts will be evaluated, based on the requirements for different industrial scenarios. The methods are then compiled into a framework that allows for the description and modeling of such systems in terms of adaptability to a problem domain. Where necessary, new methods or tools will be introduced to close the gap between inconsistent modeling artifacts. The framework shall then be used to build learning agents for real-life scenarios and observe their application in a case study.

However current agent models do not offer a proper support for developing AmI systems because they do not offer support to model explicitly the interaction between the agent, context sources and effectors, and the context-awareness features are scattered in the system model.

Because of the complicated behavior of the mobile agents, there has not been much work done in modeling and simulation. In this paper, a Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) is used to model the mobile agents in DSNs. GSPN is a very popular modeling tool for systems that feature concurrency, synchronization and randomness. One of the most challenging problems in GSPN modeling is to design a mechanism for breaking the transition conflicts. This paper presents a random transition selector based on joint entropy and a so-called ""rolling rocks random (R3) selector"" to break conflicts among immediate transitions. The GSPN model based on this transition selector is synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex 1000E Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using reconfigurable components.

They use sensor and actuator networks deployed on people and the surrounding environment. Such networks are complex systems with distributed configurations. This issue causes difficulties in their development and configuration. To alleviate these problems, simulations become a key tool. They provide controlled environments to develop and test components. However, the use of simulations has downsides. Their development usually demands multidisciplinary groups, where misunderstandings due to different backgrounds are frequent. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) can help to alleviate this kind of problems. This paper introduces a framework for the development of simulations of Smart Roads following the Model-Driven Architecture (a specific MDE approach). It extends an existing MDE framework for simulations of road traffic with specific elements for Smart Roads (e.g., sensors and services). Two different Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are respectively modeled to address these issues. The proposed framework also provides two specific support tools: a code generator to transform the models into source code, and an agent-based simulation platform for road traffic. A case study illustrates how to adapt the produced model specifications to the specific requirements of the road traffic platform. These specifications are included into a simulation based on tracking vehicles using sensors. Promising results have been obtained showing the viability of the proposal.","['Spain', 'Spain', 'Spain']","['Rey Juan Carlos University', 'Complutense University of Madrid', 'Rey Juan Carlos University']"

This separation allows modular model-driven development of robotics applications and enables the reuse and adaptation of models and applications without need for invasive modifications. We present a framework with a family of modeling languages for conceptual, platform-independent applications, tasks, robots, and worlds. The model-driven RoboTask framework integrates these languages with a runtime architecture to execute robotics tasks using a planner and mappings from conceptual models to actual platforms.

Contemporary software-based solutions are composed of several software systems, that form System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS differentiating characteristics, such as emergent behavior, introduce specific issues that render their security modeling, simulation and analysis a critical challenge. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering (SE) approaches can be leveraged to model and analyze secure SoS solutions for predicting high impact (cascading) attacks at the architecture stage. In order to achieve this objective, we propose a Model Driven Engineering method, Systems-of-Systems Security (SoSSec), that comprises: (1) a modeling language (SoSSecML) for secure SoS modeling and (2) Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for security analysis of SoS architectures. To illustrate our proposed approach in terms of modeling, simulating, and discovering attacks, we have conducted a case study on a real-life smart building SoS, the Adelaide University Health and Medical School (AHMS). The results from this case study demonstrate that our proposed method discovers cascading attacks comprising of a number of individual attacks, such as a Denial of Service, that arise from a succession of exploited vulnerabilities through interactions among the constituent systems of SoS.

The main idea of this tool is to combine colored timed Petri nets with the queueing systems, and it aims to make simulation over the model more efficient. Due to the wide acceptance of priority rules in the wafer manufacturing industry, we also proposed a mechanism to realize priority rules in the QCPN models. Since it is known that no single rule can dominate in any circumstance, we proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal combination of a number of priority rules based on the status and performance measures of the fab. Our approach can be considered as taking the advantage of the lot execution sequence generated by priority rules to guide the search. This approach can reduce the solution space and help us find the good solution more quickly. In addition, the QCPN-based GA scheduler can greatly reduce the computation time so that this GA scheduler can meet the need for a rapidly changing environment. Note to Practitioners-Performance evaluation and scheduling are two functions required by fab managers and engineers. This paper proposed a tool which consists of a simulator and a scheduler. By connecting to the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and providing the scheduling rules, we can see how the fab runs virtually with the simulator. General information such as throughput and average cycle time and specific information like lot activity history can be obtained. This can be used for decision making, delivery prediction, bottleneck seeking, and testing of newly developed heurisitcs. The implementation cost is only on data communication between the MES and the simulator and the incorporation of rule modules. The scheduler, which takes the simulator as the performance evaluation module, can generate the suitable scheduling rule based on the current fab status, preference of performance criteria, and rule candidates. There is almost no extra cost after the simulator is connected to the MES. The scheduler can be easily made faster by common parallelization techniques. © 2006 IEEE.","['Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan']","['National Taiwan University', 'National Taiwan University', 'National Taiwan University']"

Based on the Multi-Agent System paradigm, this paper proposes an efficient approach to build intelligent systems, the active components of which are cognitive agents (i.e. an agent is endowed with various abilities to solve problems, interact with other agents). In our approach, agent behavior is viewed as an organized collection of abstract actions considered as an abstract control pattern. As agents are willing to cooperate, they exchange their respective plans and coordinate them to cancel negative interactions and to take advantage of helpful ones. The coordination mechanism relies on distributed planning. Concurrent plans are specified through the Recursive Petri Net formalism. A transformation method refines an agent's plan (i.e. control pattern) dynamically thus enabling agents' roles to be predicted and validated formally. The coordination model combines two paradigms: remote and situated coordination that satisfie the following requirements: domain independence, broad coverage of interacting situations, operational coordination semantics and natural expression for the designer.",['France'],['Institut Galilée']

However, the execution of a large number of test cases during the evolution of transformation programs is time-consuming and may include a lot of overlap between the test cases.

Rule-based DSE [10,14,18] aims to find such candidates that are reachable from an initial model by applying a sequence of exploration rules. Solving a rule-based DSE problem is a difficult challenge due to the inherently dynamic nature of the problem. In the current paper, we propose to integrate multi-objective optimization techniques by using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA) to drive rule-based design space exploration. For this purpose, finite populations of the most promising design candidates are maintained wrt. different optimization criteria. In our context, individuals of a generation are defined as a sequence of rule applications leading from an initial model to a candidate model. Populations evolve by mutation and crossover operations which manipulate (change, extend or combine) rule execution sequences to yield new individuals. Our multi-objective optimization approach for rule-based DSE is domain independent and it is automated by tooling built on the Eclipse framework. The main added value is to seamlessly lift multi-objective optimization techniques to the exploration process preserving both domain independence and a high-level of abstraction. Design candidates will still be represented as models and the evolution of these models as rule execution sequences. Constraints are captured by model queries while objectives can be derived both from models or rule applications.","['Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'Hungary', 'Canada']","['University of Montreal', 'University of Montreal', 'University of Montreal', 'University of Montreal', 'Budapest University of Technology and Economics', 'University of Montreal']"

As several models may be manipulated during the software-development life cycle, model transformations ensure their consistency by automating model generation and update tasks. However, writing model transformations requires much knowledge and effort that detract from their benefits. To address this issue, Model Transformation by Example (MTBE) aims to learn transformation programs from source and target model pairs supplied as examples. In this article, we tackle the fundamental issues that prevent the existing MTBE approaches from efficiently solving the problem of learning model transformations. We show that, when considering complex transformations, the search space is too large to be explored by naive search techniques. We propose an MTBE process to learn complex model transformations by considering three common requirements: element context and state dependencies and complex value derivation. Our process relies on two strategies to reduce the size of the search space and to better explore it, namely, multi-step learning and adaptive search. We experimentally evaluate our approach on seven model transformation problems. The learned transformation programs are able to produce perfect target models in three transformation cases, whereas precision and recall values larger than 90% are recorded for the four remaining cases.","['Canada', 'Canada']","['University of Montreal', 'University of Montreal']"

Then, a final query is formed, combining concepts of “keyword” and “restriction sequence” and its concepts are expanded through the semantic relationship in ontology.

We outline how the approach has developed over several years through a combination of commercial software development and artificial intelligence research, resulting in: (i) a metamodel that incorporates the notion of runtime requirements, (ii) a formal language for their representation and its supporting computational model (InstAL), and (iii) a software architecture that enables monitoring of distributed systems. The metamodel is the result of several years experience in the development of business systems for e-tailing, while InstAL and the runtime monitor is on-going research to support the specification, verification and application of normative frameworks in distributed intelligent systems. Our approach derives from the view that in order to build agile systems, the components need to be structured more like software that controls robots, in that it is designed to be relatively resilient in the face of a non-deterministic, dynamic, complex environment about which there is incomplete information. Thus, degrees of autonomy become a strength and an opportunity, but must somehow be constrained by informing these autonomous components what should be done in a certain situation or what system state ought to be achieved through norms as expressions of requirements. Because such a system made up of autonomous components is potentially behaviourally complex and not just complicated, it becomes essential to monitor both whether norms/requirements are being fulfilled and if not why not. Finally, because control over the system can be expressed through requirements in the form of data that can be changed, a route is opened to adjustment and dynamic re-direction of running systems.","['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'Japan', 'Japan']","['University of Bath', 'University of Bath', 'The Graduate University for Advanced Studies', 'Research Organization of Information and Systems National Institute of Informatics']"

The agents are considered to be autonomous entities which contain intelligence that serves for solving their selfish or common problems, and to achieve certain goals. However, the autonomous, responsive, and proactive natures of agents make the development of agent-based software systems more complex than other software systems. Furthermore, the design and implementation of a MAS may become even more complex and difficult to implement when considering new requirements and interactions for new agent environments like the Semantic Web. We believe that both domain-specific modeling and the use of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction, and hence support a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs. In this paper, we first introduce a DSML for MASs called SEA-ML with both its syntax and semantics definitions and then show how the language and its graphical tools can be used during model-driven development of real MASs. In addition to the classical viewpoints of a MAS, the proposed DSML includes new viewpoints which specifically support the development of software agents working within the Semantic Web environment. The methodology proposed for the MAS development based on SEA-ML is also discussed including its example application on the development of an agent-based stock exchange system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to facilitate MAS software development, various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) exist. Unfortunately, the usability evaluation of these languages are mostly not considered or only a few assessments which cover one single MAS DSML are made. A comparative evaluation, which is missing in the existing studies, may help agent software developers to choose the MAS DSML which fits well into the system development requirements. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a comparative MAS DSML evaluation methodology based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). A categorized set of MAS DSML criteria which can be used for the multi-criteria decision making is defined. These criteria can be prioritized by the developers according to their modeling language expectations and the application of the methodology allows the evaluation of DSML alternatives based on this prioritization. As the result of the automatic calculation of the importance distributions, the most appropriate DSML is determined. With the voluntarily participation of a group of agent software developers, the proposed methodology was applied for the comparative evaluation of four well-known MAS DSMLs. The conducted evaluation showed that the agent developers prioritized appropriateness, completeness and shortening the development time as the most significant criteria for the MAS DSML assessment while the attractiveness of the notations had a minimum effect on preferring a language. Favorite DSML for each comparison category and criteria was determined within this evaluation.","['Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Turkey']","['Ege University', 'Ege University', 'Dokuz Eylül University', 'Ege University']"

These would namely provide agreed descriptions of the data structures representing the complex organization of objects and links of interest within the targeted domain. This paper analyzes the requirements for such descriptive ontologies, and contrasts the requirements to the functionality provided by some current representative approaches that have been proposed for ontology management.

The integration of Business Process Modeling (BPM), Model-Driven Development (MDD), and Ontology-based Semantic Annotation (OSA) allows the automation of the SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) services development. Three steps are used for developing an SOA solution: service identification, service specification and finally service realization.

The main goal of this work is to support the automation of the development process of service-oriented enterprise information system. The implementation results of our proposed method are discussed.

All rights reserved.Software testing contributes a strategic role in software development, as it underrates the cost of software development. Software testing can be categorized as: testing via code or white box testing, testing via specification or black box and testing via UML models. To minimize the issues associated with object-oriented software testing, testing via UML models is used. It is a procedure which derives test paths from a Unified Modelling Language (UML) model which describes the functional aspects of Software Under Test (SUT). Thus, test cases have been produced in the design phase itself, which then reduces the corresponding cost and effort of software development. This early discovery of faults makes the life of software developer much easier. Also, there is a strong need to optimize the generated test cases. The main goal of optimization is to spawn reduced and unique test cases. To accomplish the same, in this research, a nature-inspired meta-heuristic, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm has been offered for model based testing of software based on object orientation. Also, the generated test cases have been compared with already explored meta-heuristics, namely, Firefly Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. The outcomes infer that for large object-oriented software application, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm creates optimized test cases as equated to other algorithms.","['India', 'India']","['USICT', 'USICT']"

We validate our proposal by repairing a large set of broken models randomly generated with a mutation tool.","['Norway', 'Norway', 'Norway']","['Western Norway University of Applied Sciences', 'Western Norway University of Applied Sciences', 'Western Norway University of Applied Sciences']"

As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool SHAMASH, where we have exploited its object oriented structure and rule-base approach to introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface. Then, we have used a translator to transform it into predicate logic terms. After this conversion, real models can be automatically generated using a planner that integrates Planning and Scheduling, IPSS.

All rights reserved.In this paper, we apply planning-based reasoning to orchestrate the data analysis process automatically, with a focus on two applications: early detection of health complications in critical care, and detection of anomalous behaviors of network hosts in enterprise networks. Our system uses expert knowledge and AI planning to reason about possibly incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent observations, derived from data by deploying an open set of analytics, to generate plausible and consistent hypotheses about the state of the world. From these hypotheses, relevant actions are triggered leading to the deployment of additional analytics, or adaptation of existing analytics, that produce new observations for further reasoning. Planning-based reasoning is enabled by knowledge models obtained from domain experts that describe entities in the world, their states, and relationship to observations. To address the associated knowledge engineering challenges, we propose a modeling language named LTS++ and build an Integrated Development Environment. We also develop a process that provides support and guidance to domain experts, with no planning expertise, in defining and constructing models. We use this modeling process to capture knowledge for the two applications and to collect user feedback. Furthermore, we conduct empirical evaluation to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the benefits of using planning-based reasoning in these applications, at large real-world scales. Specifically, in the network monitoring scenario, we show that the system can dynamically deploy and manage analytics for the effective detection of anomalies and malicious behaviors with lead times of over 15 minutes, in an enterprise network with over 2 million hosts (entities).","['United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States']","['IBM Thomas J.

The creation of such systems is a complex task since a large number of requirements and parameters have to be taken into account. In order to improve the situation, the authors have developed a data model that can serve as a backbone for the development of process modeling recommender systems (PMRS).

In a last step, the paper illustrates an exemplary instantiation of the data model in a Smart Glasses-based modeling environment and discusses business process agility issues.

Moreover, we further investigate the reasoning problems and reasoning algorithms for FDLR. Then, the fuzzy UML model is investigated, and a kind of formal definition of fuzzy UML models is proposed. Furthermore, representation and reasoning of fuzzy UML models with FDLR is investigated, i.e.; we first consider the fuzzy UML model and the corresponding fuzzy UML instantiations (i.e.; object diagrams) simultaneously, and translate them into FDLR knowledge bases at both terminological (TBox) and assertional (ABox) levels, respectively; then how the reasoning problems of fuzzy UML models (e.g.; consistency, subsumption, logical consequence, and so on) may be reasoned through reasoning mechanism of FDLR is investigated. The formalization in FDLR of fuzzy UML models makes a significant improvement and it is the first step towards developing intelligent systems that provide computer aided support during the application design phase in order to automatically detect relevant properties of fuzzy UML models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-organizing systems can be modeled as multi-Agent systems (MAS) since they share common characteristics in that they consist of multiple autonomous systems. However, most existing MAS engineering methodologies do not fully support self-organizing systems design since they require predefined goals and agent behaviors, which is not the case in self-organizing systems. Another feature that is currently not supported for designing self-organizing MAS is the separation between the design of agent behaviors and behavior adaptation, i.e. how agents adapt their behaviors to respond upon changes. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a role modeling method, in which agent behaviors are represented as roles, to design how agents perform behavior adaptation at runtime by switching between roles. The applicability of the proposed role modeling method is evaluated in a case study of a self-organizing smart transportation system.","['Japan', 'Indonesia', 'Japan', 'Japan']","['Kyoto University', 'Telkom University', 'Kyoto University', 'Kyoto University']"

This choice is done to preserve the generality of our system. This paper focalizes on the process of the RSAW system and the interaction between the process and the knowledge representation. The experimentations conducted in real environment with the Smart Autonomous Majordomo (SAM) robot, have shown the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed system.","['France', 'France', 'France', 'France']","['CEA, Institut LIST', 'Telecom & Management SudParis', 'Telecom & Management SudParis', 'CEA, Institut LIST']"

Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) supports modelling run-time adaptation of partially structured business process models, but does neither allow selection nor sequence of tasks. Objective: Our goal is to develop an approach that computes sequences of tasks such that a context-specific goal is satisfied. We apply the SMA algorithm to support run-time planning of partly structured parts of a business process in order to find an appropriate sequence of tasks. Method: We perform a literature review in order to derive the most suitable heuristic search algorithm. To support the selection and specification of tasks, we extend the CMMN metamodel. A running example is presented to show practical applicability of the approach. Results: The extension of the CMMN metamodel reflects the requirements for serializing tasks at run-time. Furthermore, we modified the SMA algorithm and defined a heuristic function. Conclusion: Our approach allows to automatically derive execution plans for partly structured business processes depending on the context.","['Switzerland', 'Switzerland']","['University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland', 'University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland']"

Actually, adequately applying data mining is out of the reach of novice users which have expertise in their area of work, but lack skills to employ these techniques. In this paper, we use both model-driven engineering and scientific workflow standards and tools in order to develop named S3Mining framework, which supports novice users in the process of selecting the data mining classification algorithm that better fits with their data and goal. To this aim, this selection process uses the past experiences of expert data miners with the application of classification techniques over their own datasets. The contributions of our S3Mining framework are as follows: (i) an approach to create a knowledge base which stores the past experiences of experts users, (ii) a process that provides the expert users with utilities for the construction of classifiers’ recommenders based on the existing knowledge base, (iii) a system that allows novice data miners to use these recommenders for discovering the classifiers that better fit for solving their problem at hand, and (iv) a public implementation of the framework’s workflows.

Our approach takes as input an exhaustive list of possible refactorings, the initial model and revised model, and generates as output a list of detected changes representing a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactorings that should maximize as much as possible the similarity between the expected revised model and the generated model after applying the refactoring sequence on the initial model. Due to the huge number of possible refactoring combinations, a heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible solutions. To this end, we used and adapted genetic algorithm as global heuristic search.

In this paper we present an alternative approach for the automatic generation of application configurations and the reconfiguration plans at runtime. With our approach, the generated configurations are optimal as regards different criteria, such as functionality or resource consumption (e.g. battery or memory). This is achieved by: (1) modelling architectural variability at design-time using the Common Variability Language (CVL), and (2) using a genetic algorithm that finds nearly-optimal configurations at run-time using the information provided by the variability model.

This makes the traffic they comprise challenging for automated systems. The information traditionally considered (e.g., streets, and obstacle positions and speeds) is not enough to build suitable models of the environment. The required explanatory and anticipation capabilities need additional information to improve them. Social aspects (e.g., goal of the displacement, companion, or available time) should be considered, as they have a strong influence on how people move and interact with the environment. This paper presents the Social-Aware Driver Assistance System (SADAS) approach to integrate this information into traffic systems. It relies on a domain-specific modelling language for social contexts and their changes. Specifications compliant with it describe social and system information, their links, and how to process them. Traffic social properties are the formalization within the language of relevant knowledge extracted from literature to interpret information. A multi-agent system architecture manages these specifications and additional processing resources. A SADAS can be connected to other parts of traffic systems by means of subscription-notification mechanisms. The case study to illustrate the approach applies social knowledge to predict people’s movements. It considers a distributed system for obstacle detection and tracking, and the intelligent management of traffic signals.","['Spain', 'Spain']","['Universidad Rey Juan Carlos', 'Complutense University of Madrid']"

All rights reserved.Software testing plays a vital role in improving the performance of software by detecting and fixing bugs and faults which cause software failure. However, software testing is an expensive task, labor-intensive and time-consuming process in the software development life cycle. Every software product needs to be tested in order to make sure it achieves all of its goals and to detect any unexpected behaviour. One of the most critical features in structural testing is path testing which helps to find every possible executable path that helps to determine all faults lying within a piece of code. Any software pro-gram includes multiple entries and exit points. Testing each of these points is challenging as well as time-consuming. To reduce this complexity and time consuming, the use of ontologies might prove useful. Ontology is a technique used at one or more software lifecycle phases. Ontology allows for the definition of a common vocabulary and frame-work among users (either human or machines). Software development has benefited from this conceptual modelling, allowing a common understanding of the concepts involved in the software process.

Knowledge in such problem domains is already partly formalized, and allows natural functional decomposition; however, it is complex enough to justify knowledge-based implementation of process execution. Examples include, in addition to many complex business processes, such areas as law consulting, notary services, etc. The approach is based on structured functional decomposition towards primitive processes that can be described using traditional knowledge representation techniques, such as AND/OR trees or production rules. In this decomposition, both the structure of problem domain concepts and their dynamic properties are identified. A graphical notation is proposed, based on SADT/IDEF-0, extended with knowledge representation notations (graphical as well as textual) to define dynamic properties of lowest-level primitive processes. Process model in this graphical notation can be effectively translated into one-level graphical notation of extended conceptual graphs, as well as into production or production-frame knowledge representation that can be used in creating intelligent automation and/or expert systems. It is demonstrated that forward-chaining logical inference in resulting knowledgebase is modeling business process execution. Some details of implementation are also discussed, and the modeling tool supporting the proposed approach on Microsoft Visio platform is presented. The role of the proposed modeling technique in the overall methodology for knowledge-based systems development is outlined.","['Russia', 'Russia']","['Moscow Aviation Technical University', 'Moscow Aviation Technical University']"

However, it has many challenges with one of the most important being explainable AI; that is, providing human-understandable accounts of why a machine learning model produces specific outputs. To address this challenge, we propose superimposition as a concept which uses conceptual models to improve explainability by mapping the features that are important to a machine learning model’s decision outcomes to a conceptual model of an application domain. Superimposition is a design method for supplementing machine learning models with structural elements that are used by humans to reason about reality and generate explanations. To illustrate the potential of superimposition, we present the method and apply it to a churn prediction problem.","['Canada', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'Canada']","['HEC Montréal', 'Baruch College', 'Georgia State University', 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'William & Mary', 'Memorial University of Newfoundland']"

Agent-oriented software engineering introduces a new level of abstraction, that we called agent level, to allow the architect modelling a system in terms of interacting agents. This level of abstraction is not supported by an accepted set of tools and notations yet, even if a number of proposals are available. This paper introduces: (i) An UML-based notation capable of modelling a system at the agent level and (ii) A development framework, called ParADE, exploiting such a notation. The notation we propose is formalized in terms of a UML profile and it supports the realisation of artefacts modelling two basic concepts of the agent level, i.e., the architecture of the multi-agent system and the ontology followed by agents. The choice of formalising our notation in terms of a UML profile allows using it with any off-the-shelf CASE tool. The ParADE framework takes advantage of this choice by providing a code generator capable of producing skeletons of FIPA-compliant agents from XMI files of agent-oriented models. The developer is requested to complete the generated skeletons exploiting the services that ParADE and the underlying agent platform provide.","['Italy', 'Italy']","['University of Parma', 'University of Parma']"

The language and method support the analysis and design of human-agent teams through a three-step process. First, an existing system is analyzed to understand the goals to be achieved as well as the roles and the responsibilities necessary to support goal attainment. Simultaneously, a team of humans and artificial agents are synthesized wherein each entity has capabilities useful in fulfilling the responsibilities. Second, responsibilities are allocated to agents by matching agent capabilities to responsibilities. Finally, the design is vetted through the application of an extension to an existing method referred to as Interdependence Analysis. This step includes the specification of teaming behaviors between humans and artificial agents to improve system robustness.

ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring.

More precisely, we focus on (i) the representation of clinical processes by using a temporal conceptual workflow model; (ii) the definition of ad hoc temporal constraint networks to formally represent clinical workflow cases; (iii) the definition of temporal similarity for clinical workflow cases based on the comparison of temporal constraint networks; (iv) the management of the similarity of clinical processes related to the Italian guideline for stroke prevention and management (SPREAD). Background: Clinical processes are composed by clinical activities to be done by given actors in a given order satisfying given temporal constraints. This description means that clinical processes can be seen as organizational processes, and modeled by workflow schemata. When a workflow schema represents a clinical process, its cases represent different instances derived from dealing with different patients in different situations. With respect to all the cases related to a workflow schema, each clinical case can be different with respect to its structure and to its temporal aspects. Clinical cases can be stored in clinical databases and information retrieval can be done evaluating the similarity between workflow cases. Methodology: We first describe a possible approach to the conceptual modeling of a clinical process, by using a temporally extended workflow model. Then, we define how a workflow case can be represented as a set of activities, and show how to express them through temporal constraint networks. Once we have built temporal constraint networks related to the cases to compare, we propose a similarity function able to evaluate the differences between the considered cases with respect to the order and duration of corresponding activities, and with respect to the presence/absence of some activities. Results: In this work, we propose an approach to evaluate temporal similarity between workflow cases. The proposed approach can be used (i) to query clinical databases storing clinical cases representing activities related to the management of different patients in different situations; (ii) to evaluate the quality of the service comparing the similarity between a (possibly synthetic) case, perceived as the good one with respect to a given clinical situation, and the other clinical cases; and (iii) to retrieve a particular class of cases similar to an interesting one. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

So, early detection of faults can be achieved by using this approach further reducing time, cost and efforts of the developer to a large extent.

In this paper, we propose a framework for generating test data from software specifications. The selected specification is Unified Modeling Language (UML) state machine diagram. UML state machine diagram describes a system in term of state which can be changed when there is an action occurring in the system. The generated test data is a sequence of these actions. These sequences of action help testers to know how they should test the system. The quality of generated test data is measured by the number of transitions which is fired using the test data. The more transitions test data can fire, the better quality of test data is. The number of coverage transitions is also used as a feedback for a heuristic search for a better test set.

Furthermore, internal agent behavior model and interaction within the agent organizations become even more complex and hard to implement when new requirements and interactions for new agent environments such as the Semantic Web are taken into account. We believe that the use of both domain specific modeling and a Domain-specific Modeling Language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction and support a more fruitful methodology for the development of Multi-agent Systems (MASs) especially when they are working on the Semantic Web environment. Although syntax definition based on a metamodel is an essential part of a modeling language, an additional and required part would be the determination and implementation of DSML constraints that constitute the (formal) semantics which cannot be defined solely with a metamodel. Hence, in this paper, formal semantics of a MAS DSML called Semantic Web enabled Multi-agent Systems (SEA-ML) is introduced. SEA-ML is a modeling language for agent systems that specifically takes into account the interactions of semantic web agents with semantic web services. What is more, SEA-ML also supports the modeling of semantic agents from their internals to MAS perspective. Based on the defined abstract and concrete syntax definitions, we first give the formal representation of SEA-ML's semantics and then discuss its use on MAS validation. In order to define and implement semantics of SEA-ML, we employ Alloy language which is declarative and has a strong description capability originating from both relational and first-order logic in order to easily define complex structures and behaviors of these systems. Differentiating from similar contributions of other researchers on formal semantics definition for MAS development languages, SEA-ML's semantics, presented in this paper, defines both static and dynamic aspects of the interaction between software agents and semantic web services, in addition to the definition of the semantics already required for agent internals and MAS communication. Implementation with Alloy makes definition of SEA-ML's semantics to include relations and sets with a simple notation for MAS model definitions. We discuss how the automatic analysis and hence checking of SEA-ML models can be realized with the defined semantics. Design of an agent-based electronic barter system is exemplified in order to give some flavor of the use of SEA-ML's formal semantics.

Time metrics for measuring event-based response time and level of adaptability of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are proposed. Results of developments can be applied for smart transport and smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, smart logistics, smart supply chains, etc.","['Russian Federation', 'Czech Republic', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian Federation']","['InfoWings Ltd.', 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'Smart Solutions, Ltd.', 'Samara State Technical University']"

In the present paper, we propose a methodology which deals with these insufficiencies on two levels. The first level is the design. Based on teleological reasoning, each service is related to a goal which is represented by a conceptual model called an Ontology. Services are described by a functional model which relies on a core reasoning process between interacting functional components of the complex system. The process is based on Information Flow (IF) approach, where the main idea is the fusion of goal ontologies. The second level is the implementation through Multi Agent Systems (MAS).

Unfortunately, learning such global behaviors can be inaccurate and slow for systems composed of heterogeneous elements, which behave very differently, for instance as it is the case for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. Instead, to make smart decisions, such systems have to continuously refine the behavior on a per-element basis and compose these small learning units together. However, combining and composing learned behaviors from different elements is challenging and requires domain knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to structure and combine the learned behaviors and domain knowledge together in a flexible way. In this paper we propose to weave machine learning into domain modeling. More specifically, we suggest to decompose machine learning into reusable, chainable, and independently computable small learning units, which we refer to as microlearning units. These microlearning units are modeled together with and at the same level as the domain data. We show, based on a smart grid case study, that our approach can be significantly more accurate than learning a global behavior, while the performance is fast enough to be used for live learning.","['Luxembourg', 'Luxembourg', 'Luxembourg', 'Luxembourg']","['University of Luxembourg', 'DataThings S.A.R.L.', 'University of Luxembourg', 'University of Luxembourg']"

Tools required to facilitate the development of web based systems include a web based expert system shell, conceptual tools that allow for the identification of appropriate domains for web implementation, modeling tools for discretionary domains and architectures for virtual discourse. We present a shell called WebShell that uses two knowledge modelling techniques; decision trees for procedural type tasks and argument trees for tasks that are more discretionary. Rather than translate decision tree knowledge into rules for a conventional inference engine, we map the decision trees into sets we call sequence transition networks. These sets can readily be stored in relational database format in a way that simplifies the inference engine design. Although WebShell facilitates the deployment of LKBS in a web environment, it does not encourage negotiation and virtual discourse. An argumentation shell program, Argument Developer is presented that encourages participants in a virtual discursive community to understand each other's perspectives and reach decisions by consensus.

The particularity of TADAP is the utilization of Machine Learning potential to support context-aware runtime adaptation within model-driven UI. Further, TADAP allows the UI adaptation by mixed-initiative (User and System) considering the user preferences (implicit and explicit) during an interaction.

PCN (Parallel Composition Language) (I. Foster et al., 1992) is based on parallel logic programming (like Strand) and allows an easy formulation of parallel programs which can be executed on a heterogenous processor network. From our point of view this combination of fuzzy logic with parallelism offers at least two advantages. The parallel execution of large fuzzy rule based systems is much faster than the sequential case. This is due to the inherent parallelism which underlies such rule bases and the used inference mechanism. Additionally, the descriptive power of PCN allows an easy formulation of asynchronous systems, e.g. Petri nets. By this we get the basis of a modeling tool for rapid prototyping of such systems in which the system description (by the program) and the system simulation (by the execution of the program) are carried out in a common environment. We motivate these advantages by processing a rule base consisting of about 10000 rule tests and by modeling concepts of fuzzy Petri nets.<>","['Germany', 'Germany', 'Germany']","['University of Paderborn', 'University of Paderborn', 'University of Paderborn']"

This is especially true of tools that provide a large number of functionalities and views on the system under development, such as IDES for Model-Driven Development (MDD). Applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques can help in this state of affairs by pointing out to appropriate next actions to rookie or even intermediate developers. AutoFOCUS3 (AF3) is a mature MDD tool we are building in-house and for which we provide regular tutorials to new users. These users come from both the academia (e.g, students/professors) and the industry (e.g. managers/software engineers). Nonetheless, AF3 remains a complex tool and we have found there is a need to speedup the learning curve of the tool for students that attend our tutorials - or alternatively and more importantly for others that simply download the tool and attempt using it without human supervision. In this paper, we describe a machine learning-based recommendation system named MAGNET for aiding beginner and intermediate users of AF3 in learning the tool. We describe how we have gathered data and trained an ML model to suggest new commands, how a recommender system was integrated in the AF3, experiments we have run thus far, and the future directions of our work.","['Germany', 'Germany', 'Germany']","['Fortiss GmbH', 'Technical University of Munich', 'Fortiss GmbH']"

Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations.

Humans are handing over more decisions to systems that provide no explanations for their judgements unless they are enabled explicitly in their design. Trust based on a program being well written and tested correctly is not appropriate for AI-based autonomous systems. Unlike traditional software, this new software increasingly exhibit emergent behaviours making it unpredictable due to unexpected situations. Self-explanation is sometimes implemented, tracking decisions to give explanations to users. A more consistent, proven approach to self-explanation would be needed for making trustable systems. The paper proposes a research agenda to define an architecture to enable self-explanation for autonomous decision-making systems. The approach will be model-driven to facilitate reuse, the rapid development of tools and suitable abstractions for demonstrating concepts. The architecture will be informed by existing research in provenance ontology and model version research. The evaluation of the architecture is expected to be done using two case studies.

These techniques are useful to provide a comprehensible picture of the process as opposed to full specifications of process behavior provided by procedural modeling languages. Since many modern systems produce ""big data"" from business process executions, in previous work, a framework for the discovery of LTL-based declarative process models from streaming event data has been proposed. This framework can be used to process events online, as they occur, as a way to deal with large and complex collections of datasets that are impossible to store and process altogether. However, the proposed framework does not take into account data attributes associated with events in the log, which can otherwise provide valuable insights into the rules that govern the process. This paper makes the first proposal to close this gap by presenting a technique for discovering declarative process models from event streams that incorporates both control-flow dependencies and data conditions. Specifically, we use Hoeffding trees to incrementally discover data-aware declarative process models, which are represented as conjunctions of first-order temporal logic expressions. The proposed technique has been validated on a synthetic event log, and on a real-life log of a cancer treatment process.","['Italy', 'Italy', 'Denmark', 'Italy', 'Italy', 'Italy']","['University of Padua', 'Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics, and Systems Engineering', 'Technical University of Denmark', 'Free University of Bozen-Bolzano', 'Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics, and Systems Engineering', 'University of Padua']"

One such formalism is domain modelling which bridges the gap between requirements expressed in natural language and analyzable and more concise domain models expressed in class diagrams. Due to the lack of modelling skills among novice modellers and time constraints in industrial projects, it is often not possible to build an accurate domain model manually. To address this challenge, we aim to develop an approach to extract domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language by combining rules based on natural language processing with machine learning. As a first step, we report on an automated and tool-supported approach with an accuracy of extracted domain models higher than existing approaches. In addition, the approach generates trace links for each model element of a domain model. The trace links enable novice modellers to execute queries on the extracted domain models to gain insights into the modelling decisions taken for improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, to evaluate our approach, we propose a novel comparison metric and discuss our experimental design.

The technique uses the UML 2.0 model of the distributed system under test, augmented with timing information, and is based on an analysis of the control flow in sequence diagrams. It yields stress test requirements that are made of specific control flow paths along with time values indicating when to trigger them. The technique considers different types of arrival patterns (e.g., periodic) for real-time events (common to DRTSs), and generates test requirements which comply with such timing constraints. Though different variants of our stress testing technique already exist (that stress different aspects of a distributed system), they share a large amount of common concepts and we therefore focus here on one variant that is designed to stress test the system at a time instant when data traffic on a network is maximal. Our technique uses genetic algorithms to find test requirements which lead to maximum possible traffic-aware stress in a system under test. Using a real-world DRTS specification, we design and implement a prototype DRTS and describe, for that particular system, how the stress test cases are derived and executed using our methodology. The stress test results indicate that the technique is significantly more effective at detecting network traffic-related faults when compared to test cases based on an operational profile. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The results are illustrated through an application to a management system for drug monitoring. Doing so demonstrates that conceptual modeling can advance machine learning by: (1) supporting the application of machine learning within organizations; (2) improving the usability of machine learning as decision tools; and (3) optimizing the performance of machine learning algorithms.

This enables us to support workflow deviations at runtime, react to upcoming events or unpredictable circumstances, but still support the user through worklist suggestions. The developed workflow engine is completely based on declarative workflow representations, whereas procedural languages are used for workflow modeling. The described approach is fully implemented and our experiments demonstrate sufficient runtime performance for practical use.","['Germany', 'Germany']","['University of Trier', 'University of Trier']"

In this fault tree extension, several modeling features are introduced: a generalization of Boolean components to multi-state components, general stochastic dependencies among components, and finally external actions on the system as well as controllable actions triggered by the system itself. We discuss how EDFT can be adopted as a formal modeling language (familiar to reliability engineers), then compiled into a DDN for the FDIR analysis through standard inference algorithms. © 2011 IEEE.","['Italy', 'Italy']","['University of Eastern Piedmont ""Amedeo Avogadro""', 'University of Eastern Piedmont ""Amedeo Avogadro""']"

As metamodels are the cornerstone of model driven engineering and they evolve iteratively, their evolution affects the rest of artefacts involved in a development process, e.g., models or transformation rules. Therefore, co-evolution tools for models and other artefacts are indispensable. We present in this paper an intelligent approach to adapt models by means of state-based and operator-based techniques. The defined co-evolution process consists of four phases. Initially, changes between two metamodel versions are detected. After that, evolution scenario is reconstructed using logic programming method. Evolution scenario is first calculated from difference model and represented by a set of primitive evolution operations, after that it is transformed using an inference engine to include eventual composite evolution operations; from this scenario adaptation solutions are generated according to the evolution operator impact in model level. Finally, migration scenario is applied on an input model conforming to the old metamodel version to remain compliant with its metamodel.","['Algeria', 'Algeria', 'Algeria', 'Algeria']","['Chadli Bendjedid University', 'Badji Mokhtar University – Annaba', 'Mohamed-Cherif Messaadia University - Souk Ahras', 'Badji Mokhtar University – Annaba']"

How to prevent, detect, and correct errors as early as possible in the modeling process by verifying the correctness of fuzzy UML models is desirable. But it is difficult to manually verify the correctness of the models. Thanks to the effective reasoning service of fuzzy Description Logics (DLs), they are considered as natural candidates for supporting the verification of fuzzy UML models. In this paper we propose a complete and practical approach for verifying fuzzy UML models with fuzzy DLs. In detail, we first propose an approach for transforming a fuzzy UML model into a fuzzy DL knowledge base. Then we further reduce the verification tasks of the fuzzy UML model to reasoning problems of the transformed fuzzy DL knowledge base. Also, the correctness of the approach is proved, and a running example is provided to explain the approach in detail. Final we implemented a prototype that can transform fuzzy UML models into fuzzy DL knowledge bases. Case studies show that the proposed approach is feasible and the prototype translator actually works. By means of our approach and tool, the transformed fuzzy DL knowledge base and reasoning tasks can be input into the existing fuzzy DL reasoners, and the reasoning results reported by the reasoners can be passed back to the designer to improve the quality of the fuzzy UML model.","['China', 'China']","['Northeastern University', 'Northeastern University']"

The paper presents a new approach of choreography model verification based on Description Logic. A metamodel of service choreography is built to provide a conceptual framework to capture the formal syntax and semantics of service choreography. Based on the framework, a set of rules and constraints are defined in Description Logic for choreography model verification. To automate model verification, the UML-based service choreography model will be transformed, by the given algorithms, into the DL-based ontology, and thus the model properties can be verified by reasoning through the ontology with the help of a popular DL reasoner. A case study is given to demonstrate applicability of the method.

However, it is well conceivable that different types of end users may profit from different types of modeling support. In this paper, we propose an approach based on machine learning that is able to classify modelers regarding their expertise while they are creating a process model. To do so, it takes into account pragmatic features of the model under development. The proposed approach is fully automatic, unobtrusive, tool independent, and based on objective measures. An evaluation based on two data sets resulted in a prediction performance of around 90%. Our results further show that all features can be efficiently calculated, which makes the approach applicable to online settings like adaptive modeling environments. In this way, this work contributes to improving the performance of process modelers.","['Denmark', 'Israel', 'Netherlands', 'Austria', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Denmark', 'Austria']","['Technical University of Denmark', 'University of Haifa', 'Eindhoven University of Technology', 'Vienna University of Economics and Business', 'Eindhoven University of Technology', 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'Eindhoven University of Technology', 'Humboldt University of Berlin', 'Technical University of Denmark', 'University of Innsbruck']"

This method can forecast overall and local exceptions and attempt to provide evidence for handling exceptions and developing flexible workflow system. Finally, a supply chain workflow system case about a packaging factory shows the application of Label Petri net modeling method and describes computing process of SVM theory to forecast exception.
