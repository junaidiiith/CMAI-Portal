Consequently, many different solutions have been developed. [Question/problem] We observed a lack of common benchmarks, in particular for the IoT domain to evaluate and compare solutions. There are very few accessible cases (examples) for SCSs published at all. [Principal ideas/results] We propose a case from the IoT domain, smart cities in particular, which comprises of hardware and software components. Starting point is a smart street lighting system with communication between the lamps and passing cars. [Contribution] First, in this paper we present our initial results of running a case study with a model-based prototyping framework on the smart street light. The framework includes a software simulation of the street lamp and the events from the passing cars. Second, an engineer can use the case as a benchmark to compare several approaches in order to make a more informed decision which approach to choose. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Case studies; Experimentation; Self-configuring systems,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988811894

However, the goal-oriented requirements modeling is not an easy way for novice requirements engineers. These professionals need more support in creating KAOS models. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g., Natural Language Processing – NLP) to support Requirements Engineering activities. In this sense, this paper aims to describe a way to support requirements elicitation for novice requirements engineers through the use of NLP within a chatbot. The chatbot (KAOSbot) acts as a KAOS modeling assistant. To evaluate our hypotheses about perceived efficacy from the novice requirements engineers perspective, we performed a quasi-experiment concerning KAOSbot’s perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. The results show that KAOSbot tool is a promising approach for specifying KAOS models because it was perceived as easy to use, useful, and the participants intend to use it in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Chatbot; Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering; KAOS modeling; Natural Language Processing; Quasi-experiment,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068606397

Subtle differences in the languages as well as modellers' preferences make it difficult to put the pieces together to provide one unified view and system. Therefore, we propose a mechanism to unify the back-end in the tool yet showing linkable ORM, UML, and ER diagrams in the interface. This is achieved by taking a two-pronged approach: 1) supporting full expressiveness of these languages and relying on a unifying metamodel, and 2) a logics back-end for their evidence-driven profiles in DL. Both have a set of rules for inter-model assertions. These profiles are tractable. As a result, we propose an architectural design for a tool that would help to integrate heterogeneous conceptual models and link them with ontologies, based on clear semantic specifications and with tractable algorithms. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

Comparing workflow modeling and artificial intelligence planning process, if the Web service as a planned action (or activity), then the modern AI planning and workflow modeling to integrate, so we can use AI planning technology to solve the distributed workflow modeling. This paper presents a distributed service workflow model based on user demand (DSWMoUD), which is composed of the web services organizations model, the business concept model, business logic model, user demand model, business scheduling model and business enactment model. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency of distributed service, our proposed distributed service organizations model made up of web service registration system(WSRS) and web service spanning tree (WSST), and we give a building algorithm for WSST and a business logic spanning graph algorithm. Introducing the artificial intelligence planning techniques into the distributed workflow modeling, we implement the prototype system, which is Self-Adaptive Web Contractual Computing Management System (SAWCM). Property analysis of the new model is also made, which leads to the conclusion that the DSWMoUD may be applied as an optimized approach towards efficient and effective distributed service workflow modeling. © 2010 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence planning; Distributed computing; Services workflow; Workflow modeling,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952394060

However the design of systems with metacognitive capabilities is a difficult task due to the number and complexity of processes involved. This paper presents a domain-specific visual language specifically developed for modeling metacognition in intelligent systems called M++. In M++ the specifications of the cognitive level (object-level) and metacognitive level (meta-level) are supported in a metamodel configured according to the standard Meta-Object Facility (MOF) of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) methodology. M++ allows the generation of metacognitive diagrams in a visual editor named MetaThink. A validation process was conducted to ensure the reliability of M++ in terms of quality of the notation and consistency of generated models. The validation was performed using two techniques: (i) empirical study and (ii) model tracing. The results given in the experimental study demonstrate that M++ is a useful notation for the process of modeling metacognitive components in intelligent systems. Metacognitive models generated from the validation process using the Tracing technique were consistent with the MOF-based metamodel. M++ contribute to cognitive architecture research adding precision to metacognitive concepts and enabling cognitive architecture researchers to do fast and exploratory prototyping of metacognitive systems using MetaThink tool. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, a formal semantics is also introduced to precisely express and explain the properties of a graphical structure. The novel feature of the graphical language is that it complements the Interdependence Analysis Color Scheme in a way that explicitly models negative influences and, in addition, provides a visual-communication aid for developers.

FTO-PN has extended Petri nets (PN) supporting object-oriented modeling and temporal fuzzy learning based on timed hierarchical object-oriented Petri net (TOPN) and fuzzy timed Petri net (FTPN). Our focus is the adaptation according to TOPN concepts of cooperation objects for supporting synchronous and asynchronous communications and the temporal fuzzy learning proposed in FTPN. These two diagrams have been chosen because they are the most commonly used in modeling MAS and describing agent learning and reasoning ability. That is to say, they can be used to model and illustrate both the structural and dynamic aspects of MAS. Not only the proposed FTOPN can be used to model complex MAS, but also FTOPN model can be refined into the object-oriented implementation easily. It has bridged the gap between the formal modeling and the system refinement, which can overcome the development problems in agent-oriented software engineering.

New CASE environments are now experimenting with formal modeling languages and various techniques for validating conceptual models, though it seems difficult to come up with a technique that handles the linguistic barriers between the parties involved in a satisfactory manner. In this article, we discuss the theoretical basis of an explanation component implemented for the PPP CASE environment.

It describes properties of the modeling language and the conceptual models in terms familiar to users, and the explanations can be combined with graphical model views.

Current research in knowledge-driven activity modelling has mainly focused on single activities with little attention being paid to the modelling of composite activities such as interleaved and concurrent activities. This paper presents a hybrid approach to composite activity modelling by combining ontological and temporal knowledge modelling formalisms. Ontological modelling constructors, i.e. concepts and properties for describing composite activities, have been developed and temporal modelling operators have been introduced. As such, the resulting approach is able to model both static and dynamic characteristics of activities. Several composite activity models have been created based on the proposed approach. In addition, a set of inference rules has been provided for use in composite activity recognition. A concurrent meal preparation scenario is used to illustrate both the proposed approach and associated reasoning mechanisms for composite activity recognition. © 2012 IEEE.",activity modelling; concurrent activities; interleaved activities; ontologies; smart homes; Temporal knowledge,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868089033

Yet, three major challenges stand out in engineering any business transformation process. The first challenge is accurate modeling of the transformation knowledge that may be scattered across multiple application domains. The second challenge is efficient and precise real-time evaluation based on the knowledge model. The third challenge will be to generate intelligent recommendations about business transformation that can significantly improve the business process and drive down opportunity costs. This paper proposes an integrated knowledge model-driven recommender system that effectively addresses all of the three abovementioned challenges of modeling, evaluating, and recommending. Using a real-world case study on warranty processing at a major automotive manufacturer, this paper presents a novel business transformation framework that consists of a knowledge model on business value drivers and metrics, an evaluation engine for processing real-time business events, and a recommendation engine that utilizes information obtained from the evaluation engine to suggest new processes and workforce allocation strategy, which can be subjected to a new cycle of modeling and evaluation to complete a feedback loop. Our experimental study using the real-world data results in a ""25/75"" rule in predictive warranty data processing: 25% of information contains 75% of business information entropy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the system. © 2006 IEEE.",Business process transformation; Knowledge model; Real-time information ranking; Workforce allocation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35148873281

The alignment of knowledge is necessary as humans possess an efficient ability to design innovation based on business insights, while technological systems are able to operating efficiently in different environments. To support knowledge management, this study presents systematic foundations covering a knowledge-based conceptual modelling approach. On a systematic level, three procedures are presented to facilitate the alignment of knowledge between people and technology: the decomposition of concepts from design thinking in conceptual models, the abstraction of capabilities from intelligent environments in conceptual models, and the (semi-) automated, intelligent transformation of conceptual models. Furthermore, the architecture of ICT infrastructure supporting the three procedures is addressed. These systematic foundations are integrated in the OMiLAB ecosystem and instantiated in two projects. The first project revolves around PRINTEPS, which is a framework to develop practical Artificial Intelligence. The second project revolves around s*IoT, which is a unifying semantic-aware modelling environment for the Internet of Things. Additionally, two concrete cases are presented for both project.

There are several methods and models for modelling the learner in adaptive hypermedia educational systems, but they're based on the initial profile of the learner created in his entry into the learning situation. They do not handle the uncertainty in the dynamic modelling of the learner based on the actions of the learner. The main hypothesis of this paper is the management of the learner model based on MEBN and artificial intelligence, taking into accounts the different action that the learner could take during his/her whole learning path. In this paper, the use of the notion of fragments and MEBN theory (MTheory) to lead to a Bayesian multi-entity network has been proposed. The use of this Bayesian method can handle the whole course of a learner as well as all of its shares in an adaptive educational hypermedia. The approach that we followed during this paper is marked initially by modelling the learner model in three levels: we started with the conceptual level of modelling with the unified modelling language, followed by the model based on Bayesian networks to be able to achieve probabilistic modelling in the three phases of learner modelling. © 2018 ACCENTS.",Adaptive educational hypermedia; Adaptive hypermedia; Artificial intelligence learner model; Bayesian networks; E-learning; MEBN theory (MTheory); Multi entity Bayesian network (MEBN),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051278441

Model refactoring counteracts erosion of the software design at an early stage in the software development project complying with the model-driven engineering paradigm. Traditional model refactoring approaches work at the surface level by using threshold values of model metrics as indicators of suboptimal design and carry out localized corrections. Through this paper, it is proposed that identifying design flaws at a higher level of granularity will save from the vicious cycle of small refactoring operations and their cascaded side-effects. The notion of functional decomposition, as an anomalous design tendency and a dominant cause of design, smells in object-oriented software, is introduced. It is suggested that refactoring operations targeted at signs of functional decomposition instead of atomic smells achieve substantial improvement in design within a concise quality assurance procedure. The idea is realized using a deep neural network that learns to recognize the presence of functional decomposition in UML models of object-oriented software. The presented approach uses data science methods to gain insight into multidimensional software design features and uses the experience gained to generalize subtle relationships among architectural components. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Functional decomposition; machine learning; model refactoring; object-oriented design; software quality; UML class diagram,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078629047

Manufacturing engineers, however, often lack the expertise to apply advanced analytics, relying instead on frequent consultations with data scientists. Furthermore, collaborations between manufacturing engineers and data scientists have resulted in highly specialized applications that are not relevant to broader use cases. The manufacturing industry can benefit from the techniques applied in these collaborations if they can be generalized for a wide range of manufacturing problems without requiring a strong knowledge about analytical models. This paper first presents a model-based methodology to help manufacturing engineers who have little or no experience in advanced analytics apply machine learning techniques for manufacturing problems. This methodology includes a meta-model repository and model transformations. The meta-models define concepts and rules that are commonly known in the manufacturing industry in order to facilitate the creation of manufacturing models. The model transformations enable the semi-automatic generation of analytical models using a given manufacturing model. Second, a model-based Tool for ADvanced Analytics in Manufacturing (TADAM) is presented to allow manufacturing engineers to apply the methodology. TADAM offers capabilities to generate neural networks for manufacturing process problems. Using TADAM's graphical user interface, a manufacturing engineer can build a model for a given process to provide: 1) the key performance indicator (KPI) to be predicted, and 2) the variables contributing to this KPI. Once the manufacturing engineer has built the model and provided the associated data, the model transformations available in TADAM can be called to generate a trained neural network. Finally, the benefits of TADAM are demonstrated in a manufacturing use case in which a manufacturing engineer generates a neural network to predict the energy consumption of a milling process. © 2017",Advanced analytics; Manufacturing; Milling; Model-based; Neural network,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036644906

However, a proper partitioning activities to services, which is called a service design, is a challenge. This article aims to present a semiautomatized clustering method for partitioning the activities to services, which is directed by new proposed metrics cohesion, coupling, and granularity. With regard to the conflict of the metrics, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to clustering activities where the metrics are considered as objectives should be optimized. The MOEA produces a set of optimal solutions as proper identified services of a service design.

AmI proposes the development of context aware systems equipped with devices that can recognize your context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. However, current agent approaches do not adequately fulfill the requirements posed by AmI systems. From a modeling point of view, the aim should be to help in the design by providing adequate tools that assist in the development of important properties of AmI systems, such as context-awareness; and from an implementation point of view, agent technologies must be adapted to the diversity of AmI devices and communication technologies. As a solution to these issues we propose a Model driven engineering process, which supports the automatic generation of agent-based AmI systems. The source metamodel is PIM4Agents, a general purpose agent metamodel that we have adapted to support the explicit modeling of context aware systems, and the target metamodel is Malaca, an aspect-oriented agent architecture. Aspect-orientation makes Malaca platform-neutral for FIPA compliant agent platforms, simplifying the model driven process. The solution generates MalacaTiny agents, an implementation of Malaca that is able to run in AmI devices. We have evaluated the convenience of applying a model driven approach by measuring the degree of automation of our process and we have evaluated MalacaTiny for mobile phones by assessing different parameters, related to the scarcity of resources in AmI systems.

To build such complex systems, instead of writing the code from scratch, one can follow the model-driven development approach, which aims to generate software from design models automatically. To achieve this goal, two important prerequisites are: a domain-specific modeling language for designing an emergency response environment model, and transformation programs for automatic code generation from a model. In addition, for modeling with the language, a modeling tool is required, and for executing the generated code there is a need to a platform. In this paper, a model-driven framework for developing multi-agent systems in emergency response environments is provided which includes several items. A domain-specific modeling language as well as a modeling tool is developed for this domain. The language and the tool are called ERE-ML and ERE-ML Tool, respectively. Using the ERE-ML Tool, a designer can model an emergency response situation and then validate the model against the predefined constraints. Furthermore, several model to code transformations are defined for automatic multi-agent system code generation from an emergency response environment model. For executing the generated code, an extension of JAMDER platform is also provided. To evaluate our framework, several case studies including the Victorian bushfire disaster are modeled to show the ability of the framework in modeling real-world situations and automatic transformation of the model into the code. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Domain-specific modeling language; Emergency response environment; ERE-ML; Model to code transformation; Model-driven development; Multi-agent system,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031489970

For better support and services, fog layer is introduced in order to manage the IoT applications demands like latency, responsiveness, deadlines, resource availability and access time etc. of the fog nodes. However, there are some issues related to resource management and fog nodes allocation to the requesting application based on user expectations in the fog layer that need to be addressed. In this paper, we have proposed a Framework, based on Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) that practices Machine Learning algorithms and places fog enabled IoT applications at a most suitable fog node. MDSE is meant to develop software by exploiting the problem at domain model level. It is the abstract representation of knowledge that enhances productivity by maximization of compatibility between the systems. The proposed framework is a meta-model that prioritizes the placement requests of applications based on their required expectations and calculates the abilities of the fog nodes for different application placement requests. Rules based machine learning methods are used to create rules based on user’s requirements metrics and then results are optimized to get requesting device placement in the fog layer. At the end, a case study is conducted that uses fuzzy logic for application mapping and shows how the actual application placement will be done by the framework. The proposed meta-model reduces complexity and provides flexibility to make further enhancements according to the user’s requirement to use any of the Machine Learning approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Application placement; Cloud computing; Fog computing; Fog computing nodes; Fuzzy logic; Internet of Things; Machine learning; Meta-modeling; Model driven; Model driven software engineering,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093094169

Domain modelling is used during requirements analysis or the early stages of design to transform informal requirements written in natural language to domain models which are analyzable and more concise. Since domain modelling is time-consuming and requires modelling skills and experience, many approaches have been proposed to extract domain concepts and relationships automatically using extraction rules. However, relationships and patterns are often hidden in the sentences of a problem description. Automatic recognition of relationships or patterns in those cases requires context information and external knowledge of participating domain concepts, which goes beyond what is possible with extraction rules. In this paper, we draw on recent work on domain model extraction and envision a novel technique where sentence boundaries are customized and clusters of sentences are created for domain concepts. The technique further exploits a BiLSTM neural network model to identify relationships and patterns among domain concepts. We also present a classification strategy for relationships and patterns and use it to instantiate our technique. Preliminary results indicate that this novel idea is promising and warrants further research. © 2020 IEEE.",Domain Model; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks; Machine Learning (ML); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Neural Networks; Patterns; Relationships,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096750387

In the recommendation systems, user modeling is a crucial step. Whether the model can accurately describe the users' interests directly determines the quality of the personalized recommendations. At present in most personalized service systems keywords models or user-item models are used to describe the users' preferences, but vectors or matrixes used in these models do not contain semantic information, so it is difficult to accurately model the users' interests and hobbies, and it is also hard to extend the users' interests. Ontology as a tool used to describe the domain knowledge is very powerful in conceptual describing and logical reasoning. Computation of the neighbor set of users or resources is also an important step in the recommendation, but at present three commonly used similarity algorithms have some shortcomings which lead the system sometimes difficulty to find similar users or resources. This paper presents a new ontology-based user modeling approach and an improved similarity algorithm. Our experiments show that the user model presented in this paper can effectively describe the users' personalized preferences, and we also prove that the improved similarity algorithm is better than other three commonly used similarity algorithms. © 2010 IEEE.",Ontology; Personalized recommendation; Semantic reasoning; Similarity measure; User modeling,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958609383

These models are used to depict the ontological organization of relevant concepts or entities. Such formalisms share a common modeling approach, based on the notions of class or entity and the relations or associations between classes or entities. Recent developments in knowledge representation using logic-based ontologies have created new possibilities for conceptual data modeling. It also raises the question of how existing conceptual models using ER, UML or ORM could be translated into Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that have proved to be particularly appropriate for formalizing ontologies and reasoning about them. Given a conceptual data model, two assumptions are usually made that are not explicitly stated but need to be clarified for its DL translation: (1) disjointness assumption: all the classes are to be assumed pairwise disjoint if not specified otherwise; and (2) covering assumption: the content of every class must correspond to the union of its immediate subclasses (this includes the assumption that we do not consider anything apart from what is expressed in the model). In this paper we propose two simple procedures to assist modelers with integrating these assumptions into their models, thereby allowing for a more complete translation into DLs.

Therefore, an efficient and accurate development of UI's is desirable in early Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases. To achieve this, Object Management Group (OMG) introduced Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) standard in 2013. IFML provides the modeling of manifold UI's for different applications like mobile, web and desktop. Although IFML is based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principle, the development of user interface models from initial requirements is still complex and time consuming task. Particularly, it requires domain expertise to understand several IFML concepts like domain model, view container etc. for the proper modeling of user interfaces. Consequently, there is a strong need of an approach to automate the development of IFML models from initial plain text requirements. This article presents a novel framework to automatically generate IFML models from textual requirements by utilizing the features of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Particularly, a set of NLP rules are developed to extract important IFML elements like View Components, Events etc. from textual requirements. Furthermore, a comprehensive algorithm is developed for the systematic execution of NLP rules in order to generate both IFML Domain and Core models. As a part of research, a sophisticated $T$ ext to IF ML (T2IF) tool is developed. The feasibility of proposed framework is demonstrated through movie manager and online bookstore case studies. The evaluation results prove that the proposed framework is capable of generating IFML models from textual requirements with high accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; IFML; NLP; T2IF tool; user interfaces,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078358992

This paper proposes a novel approach to generate test case scenarios for an aspect oriented program derived from 'Unified Modeling Language' (UML). Combined heuristic approach using Genetic and Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm is being employed to reduce or minimize the number of test case scenarios. This paper caters to save time, cost and effort by efficiently generating optimal and minimal test sequences in order to obtain the aspectual branch coverage criteria for testing the behavior of AOP. This approach has been applied on a well-known aspect oriented software testing problem namely, 'Heating kettle problem'. Effectiveness of proposed technique is justified by analyzing it with GA and Fuzzy method individually. The results show that proposed approach tremendously reduces the number of test case scenarios by satisfying aspectual branch coverage criteria. © 2017 IEEE.",Aspect integrated UML activity diagram; Aspect-Oriented Software Testing; Aspectual branch coverage criteria; Fuzzy Clustering; Genetic Algorithm; Heuristic Techniques,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039984329

It has been reported that SN P systems with colored spikes are computationally capable, and perform well in describing behaviors of complex systems. Nonetheless, some practical issue is open to be investigate, such as workflow and traffic flow modeling. In this paper, a parallel workflow pattern modeling using SN P systems with colored spikes is proposed. As results, 20 designs are constructed using SN P systems for 20 classical workflow patterns. The functioning processes that operate both sequentially and simultaneously in the workflow pattern are able to be modeled and simulated.

One of the key issues is to model the SoS requirements and automate the verification procedure. To solve the problem of modeling and verification, meta-models are proposed to refine both functional and non-functional characteristics of the SoS requirements. A domain-specific modeling language is defined by extending Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and association with fuzzy constructs to model the vague and uncertain concepts of the SoS quality requirements. The efficiency evaluation function of the cloud model is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the SoS quality requirements. Then a concise algorithm transforms the fuzzy UML models into the description logic (DL) ontology so that the verification can be automated with a DL reasoner.

However, the development of MASs is not trivial due to the various agent properties such as autonomy, responsiveness, and proactiveness, and the need for realization of the many different agent interactions. To support the development of MASs various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) have been introduced that provide a declarative approach for modeling and supporting the generation of agent-based systems. To be effective, the proposed DSMLs need to meet the various stakeholder concerns and the related quality criteria for the corresponding MASs. Unfortunately, very often the evaluation of the DSML is completely missing or has been carried out in idiosyncratic approach. If the DSMLs are not well defined, then implicitly this will have an impact on the quality of the MASs. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework and systematic approach for assessing existing or newly defined DSMLs for MASs. The evaluation is specific for MAS DSMLs and targets both the language and the corresponding tools. To illustrate the evaluation approach, we first present SEA_ML, which is a model-driven MAS DSML for supporting the modeling and generation of agent-based systems. The evaluation of SEA_ML is based on a multi-case study research approach and provides both qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis.

Therefore, the MAS environment should be tested and monitored against the unwanted emergent behaviors. The AOSE methodologies usually do not cover monitoring and testing.

However, a weakly hard real-time system integrates both these requirements. The problem with these systems is the limitation of the scheduling analysis method which only uses the traditional scheduling approach. Besides that, the current framework has problems with the complexity and predictability of the systems. This paper proposes a scheduling analysis framework based on, namely: the suitability of scheduling algorithms, the weakly hard real-time modelling and genetic algorithm approach for predicting the weakly hard real-time tasks. Initially, the best fitting specification of a weakly hard real-time system was integrated into the proposed framework and tested in the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems (MARTE) profile. Sequence diagram complexity factor metrics were used to measure the behavioural complexity of the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time (SPT) and MARTE profiles. Further, the genetic algorithm approach was applied on the framework to measure the predictability of the soft real-time tasks. The results of the framework showed that the number of deadlines missed among the tasks was optimized by applying the framework on a case study. In conclusion, the proposed scheduling analysis framework provides a less complex design through the UML design modelling, as well as increasing the predictability of the systems. © SCRG Publication, 2013.",Genetic algorithm approach; Scheduling analysis; Scheduling analysis framework; UML modeling language; Weakly hard real-time systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894104538

Learning-based autonomous systems which are called AI are treated as an inherently untrustworthy ‘black box,’ because machine learning or deep learning algorithms are difficult for humans to understand. Robot systems such as assistive robots, which work closely with humans, however, should be trusted. Systems should therefore achieve accountability for all stakeholders. However, most research in this field has focused on particular systems and situations, and no general design architecture exists. In this study, we propose a new design method, focused on accountability and transparency, for learning-based robot systems. Describing the entire system is a necessary first step, and transcribing the described system for each stakeholder based on several principles is effective for achieving accountability. The method improves transparency for systems, including learning algorithms. A standing assistive robot is used as an example of the entire system to clarify which system parts require greater transparency. This study adopted the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to describe the system and the described system is used for the information representation. Information should be represented considering the relationships between stakeholders, information, and the system interface. Because of their complexity, it is difficult for humans to understand the complete set of information available in robot systems. Systems should therefore present only the information required, depending on the situation. The stakeholder–interface relationship is also important because it is more beneficial for professionals to view information relevant to their specialized field, which would be difficult for others to understand. By contrast, the interface should be intuitive for general users. Visualization and sound are very useful means of transmitting information, with advantages and disadvantages for different circumstances. These relationships are important for achieving accountability. Finally, we show an example of implementation with a developed support system. It is confirmed that accountable systems can be designed based on the proposed design architecture. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and The Robotics Society of Japan.",black box; Health care management; physically assistive devices; robot ethics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075135772

There is much research and development investigating this area, with a wide variety of proposed explanation techniques for AI/ML across a variety of data modalities. In this paper we investigate which modality of explanation to choose for a particular user and task, taking into account relevant contextual information such as the time available to them, their level of skill, what level of access they have to the data and sensors in question, and the device that they are using. Additional environmental factors such as available bandwidth, currently usable sensors and services are also able to be accounted for. The explanation techniques that we are investigating range across transparent and post-hoc mechanisms and form part of a conversation with the user in which the explanation (and therefore human understanding of the AI decision) can be ascertained through dialogue with the system. Our research is exploring generic techniques that can be used to underpin useful explanations in a range of modalities in the context of AI/ML services that operate on multisensor data in a distributed, dynamic, contested and adversarial setting. We define a meta-model for representing this information and through a series of examples show how this approach can be used to support conversational explanation across a range of situations, datasets and modalities. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

According to this, the development process for agent based simulation should focus on modeling rather than implementation (i.e., programming on some concrete agent simulation platform). This requires the use of transformation tools from simulation models to implementation code. Describing social phenomena with a visual, high-level modeling language and implementing the simulation in this way should facilitate the use of toolkits by experts in social sciences without a deep knowledge of programming concerns. This simulation approach is supported here by the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK), which provides a model editor for multi-agent systems, and code generation support. To validate the transformation mechanism, we have modeled a concrete social system with the INGENIAS agent-oriented modeling language, and generated two independent implementations for two different platforms (Repast and Mason simulation toolkits). This experimentation shows the feasibility of the model driven implementation approach and has enabled the . study of facilities provided by simulation toolkits that can have impact on the transformation process, in particular, the scheduling techniques. Also, comparing the simulation results of the case study with the original work and between implementations has led us to discover biases introduced by simulation mechanisms that can be found in most simulation platforms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750237332

For instance, knowledge-driven activity recognition has recently attracted increasing attention but mainly focused on simple activities. This paper extends previous work by introducing a knowledge-driven approach to recognition of composite activities such as interleaved and concurrent activities. The approach combines the recognition of single and composite activities into a unified framework. To support composite activity modelling, it combines ontological and temporal knowledge modelling formalisms. In addition, it exploits ontological reasoning for simple activity recognition and qualitative temporal inference to support composite activity recognition. The approach is organized as a multi-agent system to enable multiple activities to be simultaneously monitored and tracked. The presented approach has been implemented in a prototype system and evaluated in a number of experiments.

Today, online travel agencies (OTAs) have replaced traditional travel agencies offering customers online booking services related to their travels. However, the current OTAs model is limited to the 'search, compare, and book' business process. For a traveler, it can be time consuming and labor intensive to look for a suitable choice across a large number of hotels online. On the other hand, hotel service providers cannot adaptively adjust their marketing strategies in real time according to potential customers' requirements. There is a lack of an effective communication mechanism to automatically matching requirements and interests between customers and service providers. In this paper, we propose to improve the current OTAs model with an agent-mediated tendering mechanism. We elicit the requirements of both hotel customers and service providers with the agent oriented modeling language i∗. Based on such functional and non-functional requirement analysis, an agent-based tendering system is built to help hotel service provider to proactively adapt their room price and help traveler to automatically suggest suitable hotel choices. We find that such agent-mediated tendering mechanism can pareto-improve the OTAs model in terms of the cost and benefit of both the customer and the service provider. © 2017 IEEE.",agent-mediated mechanism; hotel reservation; i modeling; pareto improvement,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041662710

These challenges invoke the use of model-driven development (MDD) along with the representational state transfer (REST) architecture to develop IoT applications, supporting model generation at different abstraction levels while generating software implementation artifacts for heterogeneous platforms and ensuring loose coupling in complex IoT systems. This article proposes an IoT application development framework, named IADev, which uses attribute-driven design and MDD to address the above-mentioned challenges. This framework is composed of two major steps, including iterative architecture development using attribute-driven design and generating models to guide the transformation using MDD. IADev uses attribute-driven design to transform the requirements into a solution architecture by considering the concerns of all involved stakeholders, and then, MDD metamodels are generated to hierarchically transform the design components into the software artifacts. We evaluate IADev for a smart vehicle scenario in an intelligent transportation system to generate an executable implementation code for a real-world system. The case study experiments proclaim that IADev achieves higher satisfaction of the participants for the IoT application development and service orchestration, as compared to conventional approaches. Finally, we propose an architecture that uses IADev with the Siemens IoT cloud platform for service orchestration in industrial IoT. © 2014 IEEE.",Attribute-driven design; Internet-of-Things (IoT) application development; IoT service orchestration; model-driven design; representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API); software architecture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084924820

There are a number of existing tools that reduce the burden of manually dealing with correctness issues in models, however, most of these tools do not prioritize customization to follow user requirements nor allow the extension of their components to adapt to different model types. In this paper, we present an extensible model repair framework which enables users to deal with different types of models and to add their own repair preferences to customize the results. The framework uses customizable learning algorithms to automatically find the best sequence of actions for repairing a broken model according to the user preferences.

Then, we evaluate how this preference extension affects the results of the repair by comparing different distance metric calculations.

Its study, as it happens with other complex phenomena, has found in simulation a basic tool. However, the use of simulations faces important limitations. Building them requires considering different aspects of traffic (e.g. urbanism, car features, and individual drivers) with their specific theories, that must be integrated to provide a coherent model. There is also a variety of simulation platforms with different requirements. Many of these problems demand multidisciplinary teams, where the different backgrounds can hinder the communication and validation of simulations. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) of simulations has been proposed in other fields to address these issues. Such approaches develop graphical Modelling Languages (MLs) that researchers use to model their problems, and then semi-automatically generate simulations from those models. Working in this way promotes communication, platform independence, incremental development, and reutilisation. This paper presents the first steps for a MDE framework for traffic simulations. It introduces a tailored extensible ML for domain experts. The ML is focused on human actions, so it adopts an Agent-Based Modelling perspective. Regarding traffic aspects, it includes concepts commonly found in related literature following the Driver-Vehicle-Environment model. The language is also suitable to accommodate additional theories using its extension mechanisms. The approach is supported by an infrastructure developed using Eclipse MDE projects: the ML is specified with Ecore, and a model editor and a code generator tools are provided. A case study illustrates how to develop a simulation based on a driver's behaviour theory for a specific target platform using these elements. © 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.",Agent-based modelling; Metamodel; Model-driven engineering; Road behaviour; Traffic simulation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957990045

Moreover, rare are the DL approaches addressing specifically requirements engineering. In this paper, we define a model-driven engineering (MDE) method based on traditional requirements engineering to improve datasets requirements engineering. Our MDE method is composed of a process supported by tools to aid customers and analysts in eliciting, specifying and validating dataset structural requirements for DL-based systems. Our model driven engineering approach uses the UML semi-formal modeling language for the analysis of datasets structural requirements, and the Alloy formal language for the requirements model execution based on our informal translational semantics. The model executions results are then presented to the customer for improving the dataset validation activity. Our approach aims at validating DL-based dataset structural requirements by modeling and instantiating their datatypes. We illustrate our approach with a case study on the requirements engineering of the structure of a dataset for classification of five-segments digits images.

More accurately, we firstly introduce our proposed architecture for a KW, and then we present the MOT (Modeling with Object Types) language for knowledge representation.

Acquisition of such formal models is either done manually, using a knowledge elicitation and modelling method, or automatically, applying knowledge discovery and machine learning techniques to available data. For the acquisition of highly structured, domainspecific knowledge, machine learning techniques still fall short, and knowledge elicitation and modelling is then the standard. However, obtaining formal models from informants who have few or no formal skills is a non-trivial aspect of knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as an instance of the well-known ""knowledge acquisition bottleneck"". In addition, if there are social requirements on knowledge representations, e.g. constructive agreement on concepts and propositions, this poses a further challenge. Based on our work in conceptual modelling and method engineering, we propose to cast methods for knowledge modelling in the framework of games.

The business process management approach is commonly used to design cross-organizational collaborations. This type of business process aims at achieving specific collaborative objectives by addressing three main steps according to a top-down approach: (i) defining the business services that have to be performed to reach the objectives, (ii) finding the best set of partners to provide them and (iii) ordering the business services in an optimized way. While the resulting business processes are a cornerstone to support the interoperability among the partners of a collaboration, their design step remains often humanly-conducted and laborious. Moreover, seeking the “best” set of partners involves non-additive criteria such as the delivery time (i.e. business services can be performed in sequence or in parallel within the process). In this context, this paper presents a decision support system based on an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to exploit collaborative knowledge gathered from companies on a dedicated platform (companies’ profile models registered to the platform and collaborative opportunity models) and deduce quasi-optimal collaborative business processes.

One of the obstacles that may limit the adaptation of new metamodels by developers is the extensive manual changes that have been applied to migrate existing models. Recent studies addressed the problem of automating the metamodel/model co-evolution based on manually defined migration rules. The definition of these rules requires the list of changes at the metamodel level which are difficult to fully identify. Furthermore, different possible alternatives may be available to translate a metamodel change to a model change. Thus, it is hard to generalize these co-evolution rules. Objective: We propose an alternative automated approach for the metamodel/model co-evolution. The proposed approach refines an initial model instantiated from the previous metamodel version to make it as conformant as possible to the new metamodel version by finding the best compromise between three objectives, namely minimizing (i) the non-conformities with new metamodel version, (ii) the changes to existing models, and (iii) the textual and structural dissimilarities between the initial and revised models. Method: We formulated the metamodel/model co-evolution as a multi-objective optimization problem to handle the different conflicting objectives using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Results: We evaluated our approach on several evolution scenarios extracted from different widely used metamodels. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach with average manual correctness, precision and recall respectively higher than 91%, 88% and 89% on the different co-evolution scenarios. Conclusion: A comparison with our previous work confirms the out-performance of our multi-objective formulation. © 2018",Coupled evolution; Metamodel/model co-evolution; Model migration; Search based software engineering,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054005619

Identifying and locating these capabilities are important to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve the overall goal of the SoS. System elements and capabilities in SoS however, are rarely stable and need to evolve in different ways and different times in accordance with the changing requirements. To manage the SoS and cope with its evolution it is necessary that the dependency links to the capabilities and the system elements can be easily traced. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability and reason about these by extending a predetermined set of possible trace links with fixed semantics. However, for the context of SoS a fixed traceability model with fixed traceability semantics is limited to consider the various different and changing scenarios. In this article, we first present the different traceability requirements for managing traceability in the context of SoS. Subsequently, we present the metamodel and the corresponding domain specific language to support modeling traceability and traceability analysis approaches within the evolving SoS context. Further, we provide the tool support for automated reasoning of traceability of SoS capabilities and system elements.

They are an important part of many evaluations. Currently, computer aided assessments are widely used for multiple choice questions, however, they do not have the ability to evaluate a student's knowledge more comprehensively, going beyond right or wrong, which is necessary for the job with the diagram. This research project presents an innovative approach for automatic evaluation of ERD. This approach proposes a solution to the challenge of encouraging students to perfect their solution: seeking, in addition to a response that returns the correct result, a note that approaches the ideal solution. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the student receives instant feedback during the practical diagramming activity, which allows the student to redo his solution for an optimal solution; (2) complete integration of ERD teaching concepts with examples of online diagrams; (3) monitoring the student's activities, i.e. how many examples were executed in each exercise, how many attempts were made. This research is a first step in building a fully assisted environment, for example, with automatic evaluation for ERD teaching, where the professor is freed from the arduous work of correcting diagrams and can perform more relevant pedagogical tasks. The method, based on machine learning techniques, uses structured query language (SQL) metrics extracted from the ERD and experts grade to create the prediction model.

However, if a generated path is infeasible due to internal variables then the transition will not be executed according to the input sequence, resulting in a test failure. Thus, feasible transition paths (FTPs) must be generated to run transition coverage tests. Objective Several automatic transition path generation studies have been conducted using genetic algorithms (GAs), but when generating a transition path using a GA, the dependent transition pairs serve as distractions. Furthermore, counter problems that require repeated execution of dependent transitions (for example, to test a failing operation of an automatic teller machine, the password must be incorrect three times) make FTP generation more difficult. Method In this study, to address these issues, an automatic FTP generation method using a grouping GA (GGA) is described. Considering the characteristics of the problem, modification of the original GGA is proposed. A chromosome initialized using information from the state chart, and generating transition coverage, satisfied FTP while adjusting the length of the chromosome. Results An experiment using the ‘inres initiator’ state chart and the ‘ATM’ state chart generated FTPs successfully. In the case of the inres initiator state chart, the proposed GGA was shown to be capable of generating FTPs with a 100% success rate. In the case of the ATM state chart, the proposed GGA was shown to be capable of generating FTPs with a 100% success rate, by setting the maximum number of generations. Conclusion The proposed GGA can be applied effectively to transition coverage testing using UML state charts, and can generate test paths suitable for testing purposes by setting the genetic parameter value and the maximum number of generations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Automatic test case generation; Feasible transition path; Model-driven testing; Search-based algorithm; UML state chart,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031107154

Examples include critical infrastructure protection and transportation systems. A DAS comprises a collection of (non-adaptive) target systems (represented as UML models) and a set of adaptations that realize transitions among target systems. Two sources of uncertainty inherent to DASs are: (1) predicting the future execution environment, and (2) using functional and non-functional trade-offs to respond to the changing environment. To address this uncertainty, we are inspired by living organisms that are astonishingly adept at adapting to changing environmental conditions using evolution. In this paper, we describe a digital evolution-based approach to generating models that represent possible target systems suitable for different environmental conditions, enabling the developer to identify the functional and non-functional trade-offs between the models, and then assisting the developer in selecting target systems for the DAS. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649089469

We propose a design framework, discussing the advantages of having different degrees of abstraction at organizational level in the development of agent societies.

To this end, we propose BESMER, our project that categorizes bad smells in systems models by mining discussion forum posts of end-users of a specific systems modeling tool. Specifically, this paper describes how our three-level discovery mechanism based on machine learning techniques assisted us in finding bad smells from the LabVIEW online discussion forum. Our experimental results not only confirm that end-users also encounter the bad smells proposed by experts, but also reveal new bad smells for LabVIEW models. We also present some implications discovered from the examination of user posts and list areas of future work based on our current findings.

However, complex data analytics-based software development is challenging. It involves many new roles lacking in traditional software engineering teams – e.g. data scientists and data engineers; use of sophisticated machine learning (ML) approaches replacing many programming tasks; uncertainty inherent in the models; as well as interfacing with models to fulfill software functionalities. These challenges make communication and collaboration within the team and with external stakeholders challenging. In this paper, we describe our experiences in applying our BiDaML (Big Data Analytics Modeling Languages) approach to several large-scale industrial projects. We used our BiDaML modeling toolset that brings all stakeholders around one tool to specify, model and document their big data applications.

An ideal domain specific agent modeling language would be tailored to a certain application domain (e.g. virtual worlds) as well as to the target execution environment (e.g. a legacy virtual reality platform). This includes the use of specialized domain concepts, information models, software languages (e.g. query languages for reasoning about an agent's knowledge), as well as custom views and diagrams for designing the system. At the same time it is desirable to reuse application domain independent model artifacts such as interaction protocols (e.g. auction protocols) or goal/plan decompositions of a certain problem domain that already proved their use in similar scenarios. Current agent modeling languages cover the core concepts of multiagent systems but are neither thought to be customized for a certain application domain nor to be extended by external researchers with new or alternative AI and agent concepts. In this paper we propose a model-driven framework for engineering multiagent systems, called BOCHICA, which is based on a platform independent core modeling language and can be tailored through several extension interfaces to the user's needs. The framework leverages the reuse of existing design patterns and reduces development time and costs for creating application domain specific modeling solutions.

Fast advancement of technology has recently generated increased interest for previously non-feasible approaches for providing feedback based on learning behavioral observations by exploiting different traces of learning processes stored in information systems. Such learner behavior data makes it possible to observe different aspects of learning processes in which feedback needs of learners (e.g. difficulties, engagement issues, inefficient learning processes, etc.) based on individual learning trajectories can be traced. By identifying problems earlier in a learning process it is possible to deliver individualized feedback helping learners to take control of their own learning, i.e. to become self-regulated learners, and teachers to understand individual feedback needs and/or adapt their teaching strategies. In this work we (i) propose cognitive computer-assisted feedback mechanisms using a combination of MDE based simulation augmented with automated feedback, and (ii) discuss perspectives for behavioral feedback, i.e. feedforward, that can be based on learning process analytics in the context of learning conceptual modeling. Aggregated results of our previous studies assessing the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive feedback method with respect to improved understanding on different dimensions of knowledge, as well as feasibility of behavioral feedforward automation based on learners behavior patterns, are presented. Despite our focus on conceptual modeling and specific diagrams, the principles of the approach presented in this work can be used to support educational feedback automation for a broader spectrum of diagram types beyond the scope of conceptual modeling. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Conceptual modeling; Feedback automation; Learning process analytics; Model driven development; Model testing/validation; Rapid prototyping; Simulation; Simulation feedback; Smart learning environments,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030089858

Ontology is the study of the organization and classification of knowledge. Ontological engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) has the practical goal of constructing frameworks for knowledge that allow computational systems to tackle knowledge-intensive problems and supports knowledge sharing and reuse. We present in this paper the processes of knowledge acquisition (KA), analysis, and representation using a conceptual modeling tool, the inferential modeling technique (IMT), as a basis for ontology construction in the domain of monitoring of a petroleum production and processing facility.

Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots.

Then, using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we extract profile specific insights across related available past cases.

The notion of 'intelligent software' has emerged as a means by which enterprises can respond to changes in a reactive manner but also to explore, in a pro-active manner, possibilities for new business models. The development of such software systems demands analysis, design and implementation paradigms that recognize the need for 'co-development' of these systems with enterprise goals, processes and capabilities. The work presented in this paper is motivated by this need and to this end it proposes a paradigm that recognizes co-development as a knowledge-based activity. The proposed solution is based on a multi-perspective modeling approach that involves (i) modeling key aspects of the enterprise, (ii) reasoning about design choices and (iii) supporting strategic decision-making through simulations.

Usually, the plan is not enacted by those who created it. This results in difficulty for responders in utilizating the plan. Conceptual models have been used to gain a better understanding of disaster plans. Unfortunately, the conceptual modeling grammars used to create these conceptual models focus only on the external view of the responders and how they interact with one another; they do not represent the internal view (e.g., assumptions and reasoning) used in their decision making. Without representing the internal view, responders will not know, for example, whether the objective assumed by planners is appropriate for their specific situation. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by utilizing constructs from the intelligent agent literature since they can represent roles, interactions, assumptions, and decision-making. To understand the practicality and usefulness of conceptually representing both external and internal views of different roles in a disaster plan, we performed a case study on the role in the disaster plan of a local Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). The results of the case study show that conceptual modeling using agent constructs has great potential for aiding disaster responders in understanding disaster plans. Because of the model, the assumptions that were hidden in the plan can now be extracted and shown to disaster responders and the efficacy of a plan can be evaluated before it needs to be enacted. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Disaster management; Intelligent agent; Modeling grammar,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650713011

This situation leads to the necessity of searching for methodologies that could accelerate these processes.

In this paper, we propose a formal approach and develop an automated tool for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models. Firstly, we propose formalization methods of fuzzy UML models and fuzzy ontologies, where fuzzy UML models and fuzzy ontologies can be represented and interpreted by their respective formal definitions and semantic interpretation methods. Then, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models, i.e., transforming fuzzy UML models (including the structure and instance information of fuzzy UML models) into fuzzy ontologies. Furthermore, following the proposed approach, we implement a prototype transformation tool called FUML2FOnto that can construct fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models. Constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models will facilitate the development of Web ontologies. Moreover, in order to show that the constructed fuzzy ontologies may be useful for reasoning on fuzzy UML models, we investigate how to reason on fuzzy UML models based on the constructed fuzzy ontologies, and it turns out that the reasoning tasks of fuzzy UML models can be checked by means of the reasoning mechanism of fuzzy ontologies. © 2013 Copyright the authors.",Construction; Fuzzy ontology; Fuzzy UML model; Reasoning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874649197

However, the manual classification of metamodel in repositories produces results that are influenced by the subjectivity of human perception besides being tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, automated techniques for classifying metamodels stored in repositories are highly desirable and stringent. In this work, we propose MEMOCNN as a novel approach to classification of metamodels. In particular, we consider metamodels as data points and classify them using supervised learning techniques.

Specialized methodologies and software are being developed to solve them. At the same time, the use of generative and visual programming principles, as well as model transformations, can provide better results. In our previous works, we proposed to apply these principles combined with the model-driven approach for the automated creation of expert systems and knowledge bases. In this paper, we extend the previously developed method with new platforms, in particular: PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and Drools, as well as we add the possibility to use the decision tables formalism and Microsoft Excel tools for their construction. The modified (extended) method allows one to effectively create knowledge bases with a large number of logical rules and generate the source code for web embedded decision-making modules. This extension is implemented as a plugin for an expert system prototyping system, namely, Personal Knowledge Base Designer. This paper describes the extended method and examples of its application for the development of web application modules: for making decisions when detecting banned messages and identifying customers who violate rules of using the SMS notification service (“Detector”), and interpreting signs of emotions within the HR-Robot application (“EmSi-Interpreter”).

For reuse of existing deep learning codes, it introduces a method that imports such a program code, extracts the deep learning model architecture, and transforms it into a graphical representation that can be modified on a graphical interface. Meanwhile, a deep learning model with many layers is difficult to be visualized on a small display screen. To handle the difficulty, it proposes a method to identify the submodules called articulable subgraphs in a deep learning model and to organize the deep learning model into a hierarchical architecture using the nesting relationships of articulable subgraphs. It introduces a method to identify frequent substractures as well as articulable subgraphs as building blocks for deep learning models for levelwise views. The hierarchical representation easily enables to build deep learning models with many layers.

They can be managed in deductive databases and evaluated using the well-known forward-chaining approach. For domain-experts, however, the syntax of rules becomes complicated quickly, and already many different knowledge representation formalisms exist. Expert knowledge is often acquired in story form using interviews. In this paper, we discuss its representation by defining domain-specific languages (DSLs) for declarative expert rules. They can be embedded in PROLOG systems in internal DSLs using term expansion and as external DSLs using definite clause grammars and quasi-quotations – for more sophisticated syntaxes. Based on the declarative rules and the integration with the PROLOG-based deductive database system DDBASE, multiple rules acquired in practical case studies can be combined, compared, graphically analysed by domain-experts, and evaluated, resulting in an extensible system for expert knowledge. As a result, the actual modeling DSL becomes executable; the declarative forward-chaining evaluation of deductive databases can be understood by the domain experts. Our DSL for rules can be further improved by integrating ontologies and rule annotations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Declarative rule; Deductive database; Domain-specific language; Expert knowledge; PROLOG,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024891790

Since the practice of domain modelling requires time in addition to modelling skills and experience, several approaches have been proposed to automate or semi-automate the construction of domain models from problem descriptions expressed in NL. Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, some significant challenges remain unaddressed: (i) the extracted domain models are not accurate enough to be used directly or with minor modifications in software development, (ii) existing approaches do not facilitate the tracing of the rationale behind the modelling decisions taken by the model extractor, and (iii) existing approaches do not provide interactive interfaces to update the extracted domain models. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a domain modelling bot called DoMoBOT, explain its architecture, and implement it in the form of a web-based prototype tool. The bot automatically extracts a domain model from a problem description written in NL with an accuracy higher than existing approaches. Furthermore, the bot enables modellers to update a part of the extracted domain model and in response the bot re-configures the other parts of the domain model pro-actively. To improve the accuracy of extracted domain models, we combine the techniques of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the extracted domain models. © 2020 ACM.",Artificial intelligence (AI); Bot; Descriptive model; Domain model; Machine learning (ML); Natural language (NL); Natural language processing (NLP); Neural networks; Predictive model,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096767384

Existing configuration methods in artificial intelligence typically perform quite well in certain subareas but are hard to use for general-purpose modeling without mathematical or logics background (the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck) and/or have scalability issues. As a remedy to this important issue both in theory and in practical applications, we use a standard modeling environment like the Unified Modeling Language that has been proposed by the configuration community as a suitable object-oriented formalism for configuration problems. We provide a translation of key concepts of class diagrams to inequalities and identify relevant configuration aspects and show how they are treated as an integer linear program. Solving an integer linear program can be done efficiently, and integer linear programming scales well to large configurations consisting of several thousands components and interactions. We conduct an empirical study in the context of package management for operating systems and for the Linux kernel configuration. We evaluate our methodology by a benchmark and obtain convincing results in support for using integer linear programming for configuration applications of realistic size and complexity.

These applications are generally agent-centered multi-agent systems (ACMAS). Interaction between ACMAS agents is designed around the internal mental states of an agent and the relationship between these states and its overall behavior. Communication in this approach comprises speech acts whose meaning can be described in terms of the mental states of an agent. This interaction protocol makes it difficult for agents that have been implemented using different approaches to communicate. This paper reviews the potential for addressing this limitation through using organization-centered multi-agent systems (OCMAS) in which agent interaction is designed around macro-level concepts such as organizations, groups, communities, and roles. Although the use of organizational metaphors in agent-based application is still in its infancy, there are some emerging modeling tools that can be used to advance the existing agent-based applications into open MASs that exhibit the dynamic and flexible characteristics of open, distributed systems. The paper illustrates this potential by using a proof of concept based on decision support requirements for highway maintenance management. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Intelligent knowledge systems; Multi-agent systems; Organizational abstraction,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874607659

From a programming and software engineering perspective, this is meant to improve the modularity, extensibility and reusability of the MAS as a software system. By adopting the A&A meta-model, we consider environments populated by a dynamic set of computational entities called artifacts, collected in workspaces. From the agent viewpoint, artifacts are first-class entities of their environment, representing resources and tools that they can dynamically instantiate, share and use to support individual and collective activities. From the MAS programmer viewpoint, artifacts are a first-class abstraction to shape and program functional environments that agents will exploit at runtime, including functionalities that concern agent interaction, coordination, organisation, and the interaction with the external environment.

In this paper a methodology is proposed to allow mashup user interfaces to be intelligent and evolve over time by using computational techniques like machine learning over huge amounts of heterogeneous data, known as big data, and modeldriven engineering techniques as model transformations. The aim is to generate new ways of adapting the interface to the user’s needs, using information about user’s interaction and the environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Big data; Distributed systems; Machine learning; Mashup interfaces; Model transformation; Smart interfaces,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951207107

Hence detection of intra-model design inconsistencies is significant in the development of quality software. Objective: The existing approaches of detecting class attribute inconsistencies rely on human decision making. Manual detection of inconsistencies is exhaustive, time consuming and sometimes incomplete. Therefore, we propose an automated and novel approach to perform consistency check of class attributes using artificial intelligence. Method: Inconsistency in attribute definition and specification is detected and fixed with self regulating particle swarm optimization (SRPSO) algorithm that uses a fitness function to optimize the consistency of attributes in class diagram and activity diagrams. SRPSO is preferred since the best particle is not influenced by its or others experience and uses its direction as the best direction and the remaining particles use self and social knowledge to update their velocity and position. Result: The use of artificial intelligence technique for detection and fixing of inconsistencies during the software design phase ensures design completeness through generation of models with consistent attribute definitions and a significant improvement in software quality prediction, accurate code generation, meeting time deadlines, and software production and maintenance cost is achieved. Conclusion: Ensuring consistency and completeness of models is an inevitable aspect in software design and development. The proposed approach automates the process of inconsistency detection and correction in class attribute definition and specification using SRPSO algorithm during the design phase of software development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Activity diagram; Artificial intelligence; Class diagram; Consistency; Self regulating particle swarm optimization,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044303597

There has been a lot of research interest in generating these UML models, especially class diagrams, automatically from Natural Language requirements. The interest in class diagrams can be attributed to the fact that classes represent the abstractions present in the system to be developed. However, automated generation of UML class diagrams is a challenging task as it involves lot of pre-processing or manual intervention at times. In this paper, we present dependency analysis based approach to derive UML class diagrams automatically from Natural Language requirements. We transform the requirements statements to an intermediary frame-based structured representation using dependency analysis of requirements statements and the Grammatical Knowledge Patterns. The knowledge stored in the frame-based structured representation is used to derive class diagrams using rule-based algorithm. Our approach has generated similar class diagrams as reported in earlier works based on linguistic analysis with either annotation or manual intervention.

First, it is cast as a purely data-driven predictive task. Second, it typically relies on a mapping of dataset characteristics to some measure of generalization performance (e. g., error). Third, it tends to ignore the role of algorithm parameters by relying mostly on default settings. This paper describes a case-based system for model selection which combines knowledge and data in selecting a (set of) algorithm(s) to recommend for a given task. The knowledge consists mainly of the similarity measures used to retrieve records of past learning experiences as well as profiles of learning algorithms incorporated into the conceptual meta-model. In addition to the usual dataset characteristics and error rates, the case base includes objects describing the evaluation strategy and the learner parameters used. These have two major roles: they ensure valid and meaningful comparisons between independently reported findings, and they facilitate replication of past experiments.

A time interval is associated with each operation compose of two limits: The minimum time required to perform the operation and a maximum time not to exceed in order to ensure the quality of the manufactured products. The fuzzy sets can be applied to many fields in which uncertainty plays a key role [1]. The uncertain knowledge associated with these discrete event system with time constrains requires specific reasoning and modeling methods. Fuzzy logic provides a framework for the exploitation of fuzzy knowledge, which from a qualitative point of view gives finer results than classical logic. The paper proposes a new approach for monitoring and maintenance of manufacturing systems with time constraints that integrates fuzzy logic and P-Time Petri nets (P-TPN) tool. So, in this context, we propose a new fuzzy Petri net able to analyze monitoring and recovery tasks of a discrete event system with time constraints, using a temporal fuzzy approach.

To increase chances of adoption in industrial contexts, software systems can be modeled using well-established standards such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Given that test data generation is one of the major challenges to automate MBT, we focus on test data generation from OCL constraints in this paper. This endeavor is all the more challenging given the numerous OCL constructs and operations that are designed to facilitate the definition of constraints. Though search-based software testing has been applied to test data generation for white-box testing (e.g., branch coverage), its application to the MBT of industrial software systems has been limited. In this paper, we propose a set of search heuristics targeted to OCL constraints to guide test data generation and automate MBT in industrial applications. We evaluate these heuristics for three search algorithms: Genetic Algorithm, (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and Alternating Variable Method. We empirically evaluate our heuristics using complex artificial problems, followed by empirical analyses of the feasibility of our approach on one industrial system in the context of robustness testing. Our approach is also compared with the most widely referenced OCL solver (UMLtoCSP) in the literature and shows to be significantly more efficient. © 2013 IEEE.",empirical evaluation; model-based testing; OCL; search-based software engineering; search-based testing; test data generation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884878316

A Finite State Machine (FSM) and an Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) are commonly used for Model Based-Testing (MBT). A test case generation from FSM is easy due to unconditional transition from state to state by traversal. A test case generation from EFSM needs to satisfy the guard condition before transition from state to state. Testing from EFSM is difficult due to unfeasible paths and test data. This paper proposes a search-based approach to find feasible transition sequences and test data generation. The Unified Modeling Language specifications are translated into extended flow graphs. An Extended flow graph from EFSM specifies the control and data flow in a statechart diagram. To guide the feasible transition path a genetic algorithm (GA) framework is proposed.

By increasing the complexity of application due to the rapid change, automatic evolutionary testing approaches are essential to find solutions providing different trade-offs between testing objectives by applying evolutionary computation. This paper proposes a model-based regression test case generation framework, as an optimization solution, by impressively taking the advantages of the genetic algorithms (GAs), called genetic-based web regression testing (GbWRT). The aim of the paper is twofold. Firstly, a meta-ontology has been designed based on an in-deep assessment to capture testing challenges caused by the inherent dynamic properties of web applications. Secondly, the multi-objective fitness functions of GbWRT are defined built on top of the meta-ontology in terms of the most important meta-model features. GbWRT minimizes exploration and exploitation in regression testing using an incremental change adaption technique implemented in the proposed GA. This approach allows a new incremental regression testing strategy to solve fault detection effectiveness and the coverability problems which are extendable to different domain-specific modeling environments. GbWRT is evaluated using the proposed fitness functions on two experimental case studies. Also, the results of comparison with three non-evolutionary and evolutionary regression testing methods indicate that the GbWRT is competitive with the state of the art regarding solution quality to perform in web-based non-stationary environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Automatic regression testing; Coverage criteria; Genetic algorithm; Ontology; Web-based application,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098962673

Cloud computing is a business oriented model with efficient infrastructural usage as the prime focus while the multi agent system research is oriented towards the development of intelligent applications on distributed infrastructure.

Consequently, deriving a series of positively correlated association rules from workflows is essential to identify strong relationships among key business activities. These rules can subsequently, serve as best practices. We have addressed this problem by hybridizing genetic algorithm with association rules. First, we used correlation to replace support-confidence in genetic algorithm to enable dynamic data-driven determination of support and confidence, i.e.; use correlation to optimize the derivation of positively correlated association rules. Second, we used correlation as fitness function to support upward closure in association rules (hitherto, association rules support only downward closure). The ability to support upward closure allows derivation of the most specific association rules (business model) from less specific association rules (business meta-model) and generic association rules (reference meta-model). Downward closure allows the opposite. Upward-downward closures allow the manager to drill-down and analyze based on the degree of dependency among business activities. Subsequently, association rules can be used to describe best practices at the model, meta-model and reference meta-model levels with the most general positively dependent association rules as reference meta-model.

Although requirements modeling techniques provide mechanisms for abstraction and clarity, fostering the reuse of shared functionality (e.g., via UML relationships for use cases), they are seldom employed in practice. A particular quality problem of textual requirements, such as use cases, is that of having duplicate pieces of functionality scattered across the specifications. Duplicate functionality can sometimes improve readability for end users, but hinders development-related tasks such as effort estimation, feature prioritization, and maintenance, among others. Unfortunately, inspecting textual requirements by hand in order to deal with redundant functionality can be an arduous, time-consuming, and error-prone activity for analysts. In this context, we introduce a novel approach called ReqAligner that aids analysts to spot signs of duplication in use cases in an automated fashion. To do so, ReqAligner combines several text processing techniques, such as a use case-aware classifier and a customized algorithm for sequence alignment. Essentially, the classifier converts the use cases into an abstract representation that consists of sequences of semantic actions, and then these sequences are compared pairwise in order to identify action matches, which become possible duplications. We have applied our technique to five real-world specifications, achieving promising results and identifying many sources of duplication in the use cases. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Machine learning; Natural language processing; Requirements engineering; Sequence alignment; Use case modeling; Use case refactoring,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027940424

In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants. The end result will feature a knowledge repository and a Software Assistant acting together to help users modeling by catering for new ideas, recommendations and help. This work will also provide frameworks to create knowledge repositories and IDE-embedded software assistants. © 2019 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Digital Assistants; Model-Driven Engineering; Modeling tools,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075929720

Such constraints serve various purposes, ranging from simply providing precise meaning to the models to supporting complex verification and validation activities. In many applications, these constraints have to be solved to obtain values satisfying the constraints, for example, in the case of model-based testing (MBT) to generate test data for the purpose of generating executable test cases. In our previous work, we proposed novel heuristics for various OCL constructs to efficiently solve them using search algorithms. These heuristics are enhanced in this paper to further improve the performance of OCL constraint solving. We performed an empirical evaluation comprising of three case studies using three search algorithms: Alternating Variable Method (AVM), (1 + 1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and in addition Random Search (RS) was used as a comparison baseline. In the first case study, we evaluated each heuristics using carefully designed artificial problems. In the second case study, we evaluated the heuristics on various constraints of Cisco’s Video Conferencing Systems defined to support MBT. Finally, the third case study is about EU-Rent Car Rental specification and is obtained from the literature. The results of the empirical evaluation showed that (1 + 1) EA and AVM with the improved heuristics significantly outperform the rest of the algorithms. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Empirical evaluation; OCL; Search-based testing; Test data; UML,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933573820

Service Composition by manual cannot meet the expectations in reality, but the wholly intellectualized automatic service composition is a very complicated process. So, many applications and research about service composition are oriented to semiautomatic service composition, for obtaining optimal performance by some compositing policies. A global constraint is independent if the values that should be assigned to all the remaining restricted attributes can not be uniquely determined once a value is assigned to one. Based on the Web service ontology, the paper presents an independent global constrains-aware Web service composition approach based on semantic. Associate Petri net (APN) modeling methods which can describe multi-attribute multi-constraint relations and associate relationships between component services are proposed. Then, using the properties and reasoning rules of APN, a constraintaware service composition optimization algorithm is presented in order to locate legal firing sequences in APN model, and those corresponding to the legal firing sequences with the biggest trust value are the optimal solutions. Lots of experiments show that this semantic-based method has both lower time consuming and higher success ratio of service composition.

This lack of automation hampers the adoption of the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. Nevertheless, in the recent years, much research work has been dedicated to learn MDE artifacts instead of writing them manually. In this context, mono- and multi-objective Genetic Programming (GP) has proven being an efficient and reliable method to derive automation knowledge by using, as training data, a set of examples representing the expected behavior of an artifact. Generally, the conformance to the training example set is the main objective to lead the search for a solution. Yet, single fitness peak, or local optima deadlock, one of the major drawbacks of GP, remains when adapted to MDE and hinders the results of the learning. We aim at showing in this paper that an improvement in populations’ social diversity carried out during the evolutionary computation will lead to more efficient search, faster convergence, and more generalizable results. We ascertain improvements are due to our changes on the search strategy with an empirical evaluation featuring the case of learning well-formedness rules in MDE with a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The obtained results are striking, and show that semantic diversity allows a rapid convergence toward the near-optimal solutions. Moreover, when the semantic diversity is used as for crowding distance, this convergence is uniform through a hundred of runs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053134490

However, the increase in IoT devices has brought with it the challenge of promptly detecting and combating the cybersecurity attacks and threats that target them, including malware, privacy breaches and denial of service attacks, among others. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology and the Machine Learning (ML) paradigm in order to detect different types of IoT security attacks in real time. In particular, such an architecture is capable of easily managing event patterns whose conditions depend on values obtained by ML algorithms. Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Complex event processing; Intelligent decision making; Internet of Things; Machine learning; Security attack; Software architecture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079340111

We propose here the use of one of such BPR languages to enter knowledge on the organisation processes to be used by planning tools. Then, planning tools can be used to semi-automatically generate business process models. As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool shamash, where we have exploded its object oriented structure to introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface and, using a translator transform it into predicate logic terms.

Although the usefulness of agents is in having such capabilities, methods and tools for developing them have focused on practical physical representation rather than accurate conceptualizations of these functions. However, intelligent agents should closely mimic aspects of the environment in which they operate. In the physical sciences, a conceptual model of a problem can lead to better theories and explanations about the area. Therefore, we ask, can an intelligent agent conceptual framework, properly defined, be used to model complex interactions in various social science disciplines? The constructs used in the implementation of intelligent agents may not be appropriate at the conceptual level, as they refer to software concepts rather than to application domain concepts. We propose to use a combination of the systems approach and Bunge's ontology as adapted to information systems, to guide us in defining intelligent agent concepts. The systems approach will be used to define the components of the intelligent agents and ontology will be used to understand the configurations and interrelationships between the components. We will then provide a graphical representation of these concepts for modeling purposes. As a proof of concept for the proposed conceptual model, we applied it to a marketing problem and implemented it in an agent-based programming environment. Using the conceptual model, the user was able to quickly visualize the complex interactions of the agents. The use of the conceptual representation even sparked an investigation of previously neglected causal factors which led to a better understanding of the problem. Therefore, our intelligent agent framework can graphically model phenomena in the social sciences.

As a result, it is not surprising to see the emergence of a number of intelligent systems providing assistance in the design of such a model. This paper presents one such system, called the Intelligent Object Analyzer (IOA). One unique feature of IOA is that it consists a plugable component containing domain specific dictionary. This component is used to enhance certain aspects of the diagnostic capabilities of the IOA system. During use, the IOA has exhibited the capacity of performing two aspects of design (design synthesis and design diagnosis), and the provision of domain dictionary is proved to be one of the solutions towards enhancing the intelligence of the system.",,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034430721

Differentiating from the existing MAS DSML studies, our proposal is based on determining entity mappings and building horizontal model transformations between the metamodels of MAS DSMLs which are in the same abstraction level. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in the paper by constructing horizontal transformations between two full-fledged agent DSMLs, called SEA-ML and DSML4MAS.

This paper presents the CARINA architecture, which is based on precise definitions of structural and functional elements of metacognition as defined in the MISM metamodel. CARINA can be used to implement real-world cognitive agents with the capability for introspective monitoring and meta-level control. Introspective monitoring detects reasoning failure (for example, when expectation are violated). Metacognitive control selects strategies to recover from failures. The paper demonstrates a CARINA implementation of reasoning failure detection and recovery in an intelligent tutoring system called FUNPRO.

In the OO programming paradigm, a key concept is inheritance, the ability to derive attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes, which enables an even higher level of reusability and scalability. However, inheritance in OOBNs has yet to be fully defined and implemented. Here we present iOOBN, a tool which provides fully defined inheritance for OOBNs.

Aiming to facilitate, or even enable the modeling of complex domains, several techniques have been proposed in order to automatically generate ontologies from texts. However, none is able to generate well-founded ontologies (which are constructed based on Foundational Ontologies). Moreover, an important issue on learning from text is how to distinguish among different meanings of a word, which impacts on concepts expressed by the ontologies.

In multiagent systems, sub-problems are solved by autonomous agents that build organizational structures. Each agent internally further decomposes a problem by goal and plan hierarchies. The underlying design of a system reflects an engineers experience with approaching complex problems. It is desirable to reuse patterns and structures that proved their practical use and were validated (e.g. interaction protocols, goal hierarchies, behavior templates, organizational structures, etc.). This improves software quality and reduces development time and costs in the long run. Model-driven software engineering enables the separation of the platform independent design of the system under consideration and the actual implementation for a concrete execution platform. The gap between the different levels of abstraction is closed by model transformations. In this paper we propose a model-driven reverse engineering approach for lifting the underlying design of implemented multiagent systems to a platform independent level. For this purpose we specify conceptual mappings from the platform to our platform independent modeling language. The extracted structures have to be refined (e.g. by using existing platform independent artifacts) and can be re-used as blue print for solving similar problems on similar execution platforms.

Many modelling languages have been proposed in recent years to represent the internal architectures of such agents, for instance the UML profiles. In particular, we highlight MAS-ML, an MAS modelling language that performs a conservative extension of UML while incorporating agent-related concepts to represent proactive agents. However, such languages fail to support the modelling of the heterogeneous architectures that can be used to develop the agents of an MAS. Even worse, little has been done to provide tools to help the systematic design of agents. This paper, therefore, aims to extend the MAS-ML metamodel and evolve its tool to support the modelling of not only proactive agents but also several other architectures described in the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Data scientists need to evaluate various learning algorithms and tune their numerous parameters, based on their assumptions and experience, against concrete problems and training data sets. This is a long, tedious, and resource expensive task. Meta-learning is a recent technique to overcome, i.e. automate this problem. It aims at using machine learning itself to automatically learn the most appropriate algorithms and parameters for a machine learning problem. As it turns out, there are many parallels between meta-modelling - in the sense of model-driven engineering - and meta-learning. Both rely on abstractions, the meta data, to model a predefined class of problems and to define the variabilities of the models conforming to this definition.

Business processes are increasingly being automated yet are also expected to be agile. Current business process modeling is typically labor-intensive and results in rigid process models. For larger processes it becomes arduous to consider all possible process variations and enactment circumstances. Contemporaneously, in software development microservices have become a popular software architectural style for partitioning business logic into fine-grained services accessible via lightweight protocols which can be rapidly and individually developed by small teams and flexibly (re)deployed. This results in an increasing number of available services and a much more dynamic IT service landscape. Thus, a more dynamic form of modeling, integration, and orchestration of these microservices with business processes is needed. This paper describes agile business process modeling with Microflows, an automatic lightweight declarative approach for the workflow-centric orchestration of semantically-annotated microservices using agent-based clients, graph-based methods, and the lightweight semantic vocabularies JSON-LD and Hydra. A graphical modeling tool supports Microflow modeling and provides dynamic constraint and microservice recommendations via a recommender service using machine learning of domain-categorized Microflows. To be able to utilize existing process model knowledge, a case study shows how Microflow constraints can be automatically extracted from existing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) process files and transformed into flexible Microflow constraints, which can then be used to train the recommendation service. Further, it describes process mining of Microflow execution logs to automatically extract BPMN models and automated recovery for errors occurring during enactment. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Agent systems; Business process mining; Business process modeling; Business process modeling notation; Declarative programming; Microservices; Recommendation engines; Recommenders; Semantic technology; Service orchestration; Workflow management systems,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044479876

Application components exhibit complex dependencies on the configuration of multiple data center network, middle-ware, and related application resources. Applications are also associated with extended life-cycles, migrating from development to testing, staging and production environments, with frequent roll-backs. Maintaining end-to-end data center operational integrity and quality requires careful planning of (1) application deployment design, (2) resource selection, (3) provisioning operation selection, parameterization and ordering, and (4) provisioning operation execution. Current data center management products are focused on workflow-based automation of the deployment processes. Workflows are of limited value because they hard-code many aspects of the process, and are thus sensitive to topology changes. An emerging and promising class of model-based tools is providing new methods for designing detailed deployment topologies based on a set of requirements and constraints. In this paper we describe an approach to bridging the gap between generated ""desired state"" models and the elemental procedural provisioning operations supported by data center resources.

We use AI planning to automatically generate workflows that bring the data center from its current state to the desired state.

Refactoring represents an efficient technique to improve the quality of a design while preserving its behavior. Most of existing work on model refactoring relies on declarative rules to detect refactoring opportunities and to apply the appropriate refactorings. However, a complete specification of refactoring opportunities requires a huge number of rules. In this paper, we consider the refactoring mechanism as a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find good refactoring suggestions starting from a small set of refactoring examples applied to similar contexts. Our approach, named model refactoring by example, takes as input an initial model to refactor, a set of structural metrics calculated on both initial model and models in the base of examples, and a base of refactoring examples extracted from different software systems and generates as output a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactoring operations that should maximize as much as possible the structural similarity based on metrics between the initial model and the models in the base of examples. A heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible refactoring solutions. To this end, we used and adapted a genetic algorithm as a global heuristic search. The validation results on different systems of real-world models taken from open-source projects confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus, more attention is paid to the transformation aspects in model-driven engineering (MDE) along with the growing importance of modeling in software development. However, a major concern in MDE is how to ensure the quality of the model transformation mechanisms. Most of existing work in model transformation has relied on defining languages to express transformation rules. The main goal of existing transformation approaches is to provide rules generating target models, from source models, without errors. However, other important objective is how to minimize the complexity of transformation rules (e.g., the number of rules and number of matching in the same rule) while maximizing the quality of target models. In fact, reducing rule complexity and improving target model quality are important to (1) make rules and target models easy to understand and evolve, (2) find transformation errors easily, and (3) generate optimal target models. In this chapter, we consider the transformation mechanism as a multiobjective problem where the goal is to find the best rules maximizing target model quality and minimizing rule complexity. Our approach starts by randomly generating a set of rules, executing them to generate some target models. Of course, only solutions ensuring full correctness are considered during the optimization process. Then, the quality of the proposed solution (rules) is evaluated by (1) calculating the number of rules and matching metamodels in each rule and (2) assessing the quality of generated target models using a set of quality metrics. To this end, we use the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to automatically generate the best transformation rules satisfying the two conflicting criteria. We report the results of our validation using three different transformation mechanisms. The best solutions provided well-designed target models with a minimal set of rules. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Model quality; Multiobjective optimization; Quality metrics; Rule generation,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892168676

The reduced use of transformations for this purpose is largely due to the high effort required for their development. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an algorithm to generate model transformations by-example. It overcomes two common limitations of these approaches: the generation of many-to-many transformation between arbitrary graphs of elements; dealing with transformation languages that do not directly support graphs of elements in their source or target models.

We demonstrate how modeling game AI at an appropriate abstraction level using an appropriate modeling language has many advantages. A variant of Rhapsody Statecharts is proposed as an appropriate formalism. The Tank Wars game by Electronic Arts (EA) is used to demonstrate our concrete approach. We show how the use of the Statecharts formalism leads quite naturally to layered modeling of game AI and allows modelers to abstract away from choices between, for example, time-slicing and discrete-event time management.

This makes the development of software expensive and error-prone, even for expert programmers. Model-driven development (MDD) allows designers to model their systems at different abstraction levels and thus reduces the complexity of the development task. However MDD does not help system architects to solve the problem of optimizing the trade-off between different constraints such as memory usage, latency, and power consumption in the application design process. This paper proposes an approach to address this issue by combining MDD with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA).

In this paper, agent-oriented software development (AOSD) and MDE paradigms are fully integrated for the development of MAS. Meta-modeling techniques are explicitly used to speed up several phases of the process. The Prometheus methodology is used for the purpose of validating the proposal. The meta-object facility (MOF) architecture is used as a guideline for developing a MAS editor according to the language provided by Prometheus methodology.

This paper states the thesis that when learning agents are applied to work environments that require domain-specific experience, the agent benefits if it can be further adapted by a supervising domain expert. Closely interacting with the agent, a domain expert should be able to understand its decisions and update the underlying knowledge base as needed. The result would be an agent with individualized knowledge that comes in part from the domain experts. The model of such an adaptive learning agent must take into account the problem domain, the design of the learning agent and the perception of the domain user. Therefore, already in the modeling phase, more attention must be paid to make the learning element of the agent adaptable by an operator. Domain modeling and meta-modeling methods could help to make inner processes of the agent more accessible. In addition, the knowledge gained should be made reusable for future agents in similar environments. To begin with, the existing methods for modeling agent systems and the underlying concepts will be evaluated, based on the requirements for different industrial scenarios. The methods are then compiled into a framework that allows for the description and modeling of such systems in terms of adaptability to a problem domain. Where necessary, new methods or tools will be introduced to close the gap between inconsistent modeling artifacts. The framework shall then be used to build learning agents for real-life scenarios and observe their application in a case study. The results will be used to assess the quality of the adapted knowledge base and compare it to a manual knowledge modeling process. © 2019 IEEE.",Adaptive Learning Agents; Domain modeling; Knowledge Engineering; Multi-modeling,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075925230

The proposed model guides designers and developers of an adaptive or intelligent interface to integrate, without conflicts and incoherence, design strategies, design goals, user goals, alternative constituents, user profile, context and application domain knowledge.

They use sensor and actuator networks deployed on people and the surrounding environment. Such networks are complex systems with distributed configurations. This issue causes difficulties in their development and configuration. To alleviate these problems, simulations become a key tool. They provide controlled environments to develop and test components. However, the use of simulations has downsides. Their development usually demands multidisciplinary groups, where misunderstandings due to different backgrounds are frequent. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) can help to alleviate this kind of problems. This paper introduces a framework for the development of simulations of Smart Roads following the Model-Driven Architecture (a specific MDE approach). It extends an existing MDE framework for simulations of road traffic with specific elements for Smart Roads (e.g., sensors and services). Two different Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are respectively modeled to address these issues. The proposed framework also provides two specific support tools: a code generator to transform the models into source code, and an agent-based simulation platform for road traffic. A case study illustrates how to adapt the produced model specifications to the specific requirements of the road traffic platform. These specifications are included into a simulation based on tracking vehicles using sensors. Promising results have been obtained showing the viability of the proposal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Model-driven architecture; Model-driven engineering; Multi-agent system; Road traffic simulation; Smart roads,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073512522

Most applications are intertwined with and tied to fixed robots and worlds. Changes and evolution of a robot or world have an invasive and often unpredictable impact on the application software. We propose making the models of robots and worlds explicit in robotics applications and separate these by introducing application-specific and platform-independent interfaces. This separation allows modular model-driven development of robotics applications and enables the reuse and adaptation of models and applications without need for invasive modifications. We present a framework with a family of modeling languages for conceptual, platform-independent applications, tasks, robots, and worlds. The model-driven RoboTask framework integrates these languages with a runtime architecture to execute robotics tasks using a planner and mappings from conceptual models to actual platforms. This enables a separation of domain concerns from software development concerns and modification of applications without invasive impacts on their separated constituents.

Contemporary software-based solutions are composed of several software systems, that form System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS differentiating characteristics, such as emergent behavior, introduce specific issues that render their security modeling, simulation and analysis a critical challenge. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering (SE) approaches can be leveraged to model and analyze secure SoS solutions for predicting high impact (cascading) attacks at the architecture stage. In order to achieve this objective, we propose a Model Driven Engineering method, Systems-of-Systems Security (SoSSec), that comprises: (1) a modeling language (SoSSecML) for secure SoS modeling and (2) Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for security analysis of SoS architectures. To illustrate our proposed approach in terms of modeling, simulating, and discovering attacks, we have conducted a case study on a real-life smart building SoS, the Adelaide University Health and Medical School (AHMS). The results from this case study demonstrate that our proposed method discovers cascading attacks comprising of a number of individual attacks, such as a Denial of Service, that arise from a succession of exploited vulnerabilities through interactions among the constituent systems of SoS. In future work, we intend to extend SoSSec to address diverse unknown emergent behaviors and non-functional properties such as safety and trust. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Model driven engineering; Multi-agent systems simulation; Security modeling and analysis; Smart buildings; Software architecture; Systems-of-systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077182748

Based on the Multi-Agent System paradigm, this paper proposes an efficient approach to build intelligent systems, the active components of which are cognitive agents (i.e. an agent is endowed with various abilities to solve problems, interact with other agents). In our approach, agent behavior is viewed as an organized collection of abstract actions considered as an abstract control pattern. As agents are willing to cooperate, they exchange their respective plans and coordinate them to cancel negative interactions and to take advantage of helpful ones. The coordination mechanism relies on distributed planning. Concurrent plans are specified through the Recursive Petri Net formalism. A transformation method refines an agent's plan (i.e. control pattern) dynamically thus enabling agents' roles to be predicted and validated formally. The coordination model combines two paradigms: remote and situated coordination that satisfie the following requirements: domain independence, broad coverage of interacting situations, operational coordination semantics and natural expression for the designer.",Collaborative problem solving; Concurrency; Coordination; Distributed planning; Interaction; Multi-agent system; Recursive petri nets,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031168551

Thus, it is important to check the correctness of model transformation programs. Several approaches have been proposed to generate test cases for model transformations based on different coverage criteria (e.g., statements, rules, metamodel elements, etc.). However, the execution of a large number of test cases during the evolution of transformation programs is time-consuming and may include a lot of overlap between the test cases. In this paper, we propose a test case selection approach for model transformations based on multi-objective search. We use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to find the best trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: (1) maximize the coverage of rules and (2) minimize the execution time of the selected test cases. We validated our approach on several evolution cases of medium and large ATLAS Transformation Language programs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Model transformation; Model transformation testing; Model-driven engineering; NSGA-II; Test case selection,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083807732

While these frameworks are efficient to design simple chatbot applications, they still require advanced technical knowledge to define complex conversations and interactions. In addition, the deployment of a chatbot application usually requires a deep understanding of the targeted platforms, increasing the development and maintenance costs.

As several models may be manipulated during the software-development life cycle, model transformations ensure their consistency by automating model generation and update tasks. However, writing model transformations requires much knowledge and effort that detract from their benefits. To address this issue, Model Transformation by Example (MTBE) aims to learn transformation programs from source and target model pairs supplied as examples. In this article, we tackle the fundamental issues that prevent the existing MTBE approaches from efficiently solving the problem of learning model transformations. We show that, when considering complex transformations, the search space is too large to be explored by naive search techniques. We propose an MTBE process to learn complex model transformations by considering three common requirements: element context and state dependencies and complex value derivation. Our process relies on two strategies to reduce the size of the search space and to better explore it, namely, multi-step learning and adaptive search. We experimentally evaluate our approach on seven model transformation problems. The learned transformation programs are able to produce perfect target models in three transformation cases, whereas precision and recall values larger than 90% are recorded for the four remaining cases. © 2016 ACM.",Genetic programming; Model transformation; Model transformation by example; Model-driven engineering; Simulated annealing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975316777

To tackle such a problem, this paper puts forward a natural-language-based intelligent retrieval engine for the BIM object database and Revit modeling. First, a domain ontology is constructed for semantic understanding, and the BIM object database framework is established for testing our search engine. Second, “target keyword” and “restriction sequence” proposed are extracted from the natural sentences of users. Then, a final query is formed, combining concepts of “keyword” and “restriction sequence” and its concepts are expanded through the semantic relationship in ontology. Finally, the results are presented after mapping from the final query to the BIM object database and ranking of results.

A promising approach in the field of multi-agent system is the design and development of complex, hierarchical and critical systems. These systems require both a hierarchical structure that allows to make together different levels of abstraction within the same system and require the maintenance of social control of the various entities involved in these systems by using social norms. Several proposals on normative models for multi-agent systems have been made in order to design agent societies in norms-based environments. However, they are not adapted to support holonic systems, i.e. those who allow to model complex organizations involving several levels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new metamodel, called NCRIO (Norm, Capacity, Role, Interaction, and Organization), for the design of normative holonic multi-agent systems (NHMAS). This metamodel is an extension of the CRIO (Capacity, Role, Interaction, and Organization) metamodel, which allows the design of holonic multi-agent systems (HMAS). The NCRIO metamodel retains the properties of the HMASs and adds normative concepts (Norms and Contracts) to maintain social control in these systems.

So far such a method has often focused on the generation of structure aspects, but have omitted the inference of OCL restrictions that could complement the domain structure and improve the precision of the domain. This paper proposes an approach to automating the inference of OCL restrictions from a domain description in terms of counterand examples.

The instantiation is achieved by the combination of the model transformation implemented by graph rewriting rules and the machine learning aiming at discover specific relationships relating the software quality concepts.

The model is expressed in a middle-level modeling language. On this particular relational learning problem, traditional top-down search methods fall into blind search and bottom-up search methods produce too expensive coverage tests.

We outline how the approach has developed over several years through a combination of commercial software development and artificial intelligence research, resulting in: (i) a metamodel that incorporates the notion of runtime requirements, (ii) a formal language for their representation and its supporting computational model (InstAL), and (iii) a software architecture that enables monitoring of distributed systems. The metamodel is the result of several years experience in the development of business systems for e-tailing, while InstAL and the runtime monitor is on-going research to support the specification, verification and application of normative frameworks in distributed intelligent systems. Our approach derives from the view that in order to build agile systems, the components need to be structured more like software that controls robots, in that it is designed to be relatively resilient in the face of a non-deterministic, dynamic, complex environment about which there is incomplete information. Thus, degrees of autonomy become a strength and an opportunity, but must somehow be constrained by informing these autonomous components what should be done in a certain situation or what system state ought to be achieved through norms as expressions of requirements. Because such a system made up of autonomous components is potentially behaviourally complex and not just complicated, it becomes essential to monitor both whether norms/requirements are being fulfilled and if not why not. Finally, because control over the system can be expressed through requirements in the form of data that can be changed, a route is opened to adjustment and dynamic re-direction of running systems. © 2014 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908881544

The agents are considered to be autonomous entities which contain intelligence that serves for solving their selfish or common problems, and to achieve certain goals. However, the autonomous, responsive, and proactive natures of agents make the development of agent-based software systems more complex than other software systems. Furthermore, the design and implementation of a MAS may become even more complex and difficult to implement when considering new requirements and interactions for new agent environments like the Semantic Web. We believe that both domain-specific modeling and the use of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction, and hence support a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs. In this paper, we first introduce a DSML for MASs called SEA-ML with both its syntax and semantics definitions and then show how the language and its graphical tools can be used during model-driven development of real MASs. In addition to the classical viewpoints of a MAS, the proposed DSML includes new viewpoints which specifically support the development of software agents working within the Semantic Web environment. The methodology proposed for the MAS development based on SEA-ML is also discussed including its example application on the development of an agent-based stock exchange system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to facilitate MAS software development, various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) exist. Unfortunately, the usability evaluation of these languages are mostly not considered or only a few assessments which cover one single MAS DSML are made. A comparative evaluation, which is missing in the existing studies, may help agent software developers to choose the MAS DSML which fits well into the system development requirements. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a comparative MAS DSML evaluation methodology based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). A categorized set of MAS DSML criteria which can be used for the multi-criteria decision making is defined. These criteria can be prioritized by the developers according to their modeling language expectations and the application of the methodology allows the evaluation of DSML alternatives based on this prioritization. As the result of the automatic calculation of the importance distributions, the most appropriate DSML is determined. With the voluntarily participation of a group of agent software developers, the proposed methodology was applied for the comparative evaluation of four well-known MAS DSMLs. The conducted evaluation showed that the agent developers prioritized appropriateness, completeness and shortening the development time as the most significant criteria for the MAS DSML assessment while the attractiveness of the notations had a minimum effect on preferring a language. Favorite DSML for each comparison category and criteria was determined within this evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE); Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML); Multi-Agent System (MAS); Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM); Software agents,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097646421

The first and the important task for developing service-oriented models is service identification. However, the majority of existing methods for service identification are developed manually because, on the one hand, they are based on the competence of the developers and, on the other hand, the business process models do not comprise sufficient knowledge to identify services automatically. The integration of Business Process Modeling (BPM), Model-Driven Development (MDD), and Ontology-based Semantic Annotation (OSA) allows the automation of the SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) services development. Three steps are used for developing an SOA solution: service identification, service specification and finally service realization. In this paper, the authors illustrate a method called MOOSI (Multi-Objective Optimization-based Service Identification) that automatically identifies the architecturally significant elements from an annotated business process model in order to specify service model artifacts. The main goal of this work is to support the automation of the development process of service-oriented enterprise information system. The implementation results of our proposed method are discussed. This result shows that MOOSI can achieve high performance in terms of execution time and important quality in terms of modularization quality of identified services compared with other solution. © 2013, IGI Global.",Business Process Modeling (BPM); Genetic Algorithms-Based Clustering; Model-Driven Development (MDD); Service Identification; Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903150944

Agents can help automate a variety of tasks and facilitate decision-making in the supply chain. Compared with other industries, there are more uncertainties existing in the fashion industry such as market needs, fashion change and seasonality, which increases the difficulty of managing the apparel supply chain especially in the ordering process. Thus, it is necessary to increase the coordination in the apparel supply chain processes and develop optimal decision-making strategy for the apparel supply chain under the dynamic environment. In this paper, unified modeling language (UML) is applied to simulate the supply chain processes and describe the relationships between agents. This paper also applies genetic algorithm (GA) and fuzzy inference theory to the dynamic reorder strategy for the supply chain agent to make optimal decision about replenishment quantity and reorder point in order to minimize the inventory cost correspondingly. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Software testing can be categorized as: testing via code or white box testing, testing via specification or black box and testing via UML models. To minimize the issues associated with object-oriented software testing, testing via UML models is used. It is a procedure which derives test paths from a Unified Modelling Language (UML) model which describes the functional aspects of Software Under Test (SUT). Thus, test cases have been produced in the design phase itself, which then reduces the corresponding cost and effort of software development. This early discovery of faults makes the life of software developer much easier. Also, there is a strong need to optimize the generated test cases. The main goal of optimization is to spawn reduced and unique test cases. To accomplish the same, in this research, a nature-inspired meta-heuristic, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm has been offered for model based testing of software based on object orientation. Also, the generated test cases have been compared with already explored meta-heuristics, namely, Firefly Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. The outcomes infer that for large object-oriented software application, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm creates optimized test cases as equated to other algorithms. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

For this purpose the process in the facility is modeled as a UML (Unified Modeling Language) activity diagram. Thereafter all of the system properties and parameters are added to the model via standard stereotypes and tagged values specified in the MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-time and Embedded Systems) profile. This annotated UML model can be automatically transformed to a corresponding Generalized Net - a summarizing concept of many high-level Petri nets modifications. By accomplishment of simulation experiments with different input parameters the production process can be analyzed and diverse execution scenarios can be compared. In this way an optimal organization in the manufacturing facility can be chosen.

Adaptation of cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer, contract based economy.

Our system uses expert knowledge and AI planning to reason about possibly incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent observations, derived from data by deploying an open set of analytics, to generate plausible and consistent hypotheses about the state of the world. From these hypotheses, relevant actions are triggered leading to the deployment of additional analytics, or adaptation of existing analytics, that produce new observations for further reasoning. Planning-based reasoning is enabled by knowledge models obtained from domain experts that describe entities in the world, their states, and relationship to observations. To address the associated knowledge engineering challenges, we propose a modeling language named LTS++ and build an Integrated Development Environment. We also develop a process that provides support and guidance to domain experts, with no planning expertise, in defining and constructing models. We use this modeling process to capture knowledge for the two applications and to collect user feedback. Furthermore, we conduct empirical evaluation to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the benefits of using planning-based reasoning in these applications, at large real-world scales. Specifically, in the network monitoring scenario, we show that the system can dynamically deploy and manage analytics for the effective detection of anomalies and malicious behaviors with lead times of over 15 minutes, in an enterprise network with over 2 million hosts (entities).

Weights are the parameters that represent the new incoming data of the system modeled by a (Fuzzy) Petri net. The weight changes meet the system changes in a variety of application domains (e.g. Intelligent E-learning, Computer Numerical Control, Weather Forecasting, and Expert Systems). In this paper, we introduce a new class of Fuzzy Petri nets that takes into account the weight changes of the arc in the Fuzzy reasoning process. We give the formal description of the model, an algorithm for learning the weights without the need to transfer into a neural network, an algorithm for the fuzzy reasoning, the algebraic forms of the new state equation, and the stability analysis.

Recent proposals to improve the ability of reasoning automatically on UML models. However, information imprecision and uncertainty exist in many real-world applications and hence fuzzy UML models have been extensively investigated. In this paper, we propose a description logic approach to represent and reason on fuzzy UML models. Firstly, for the specific purposes of representing and reasoning on fuzzy UML models, a fuzzy description logic called FDLR (fuzzy DLR) is introduced. Moreover, we further investigate the reasoning problems and reasoning algorithms for FDLR. Then, the fuzzy UML model is investigated, and a kind of formal definition of fuzzy UML models is proposed. Furthermore, representation and reasoning of fuzzy UML models with FDLR is investigated, i.e.; we first consider the fuzzy UML model and the corresponding fuzzy UML instantiations (i.e.; object diagrams) simultaneously, and translate them into FDLR knowledge bases at both terminological (TBox) and assertional (ABox) levels, respectively; then how the reasoning problems of fuzzy UML models (e.g.; consistency, subsumption, logical consequence, and so on) may be reasoned through reasoning mechanism of FDLR is investigated. The formalization in FDLR of fuzzy UML models makes a significant improvement and it is the first step towards developing intelligent systems that provide computer aided support during the application design phase in order to automatically detect relevant properties of fuzzy UML models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, this knowledge can be stored in a software knowledge base, which serves as ""corporate memory"", facilitating the work of developers, maintainers and users alike.

The first example concerns the language RML, designed on a foundation of ideas from frame- and logic-based knowledge representation schemes, to offer a novel (at least for its time) formal requirements modeling language. The second contribution adapts solutions of the frame problem originally proposed in the context of AI planning in order to offer a better formulation of the notion of state change caused by an activity, which appears in most formal requirements modeling languages.

These advances, combined with evolutionary progress in areas such as knowledge representation, automated planning, user experience technologies, software-as-a-service and crowdsourcing, have the potential to transform many industries. In this paper, we discuss transformations of BPM that advances in the Cognitive Computing will bring. We focus on three of the most signficant aspects of this transformation, namely: (a) Cognitive Computing will enable ""knowledge acquisition at scale"", which will lead to a transformation in Knowledge-intensive Processes (KiP’s); (b) We envision a new process meta-model will emerge that is centered around a ""Plan-Act-Learn"" cycle; and (c) Cognitive Computing can enable learning about processes from implicit descriptions (at both design- and run-time), opening opportunities for new levels of automation and business process support, for both traditional business processes and KiP’s. We use the term cognitive BPM to refer to a new BPM paradigm encompassing all aspects of BPM that are impacted and enabled by Cognitive Computing. We argue that a fundamental understanding of cognitive BPM requires a new research framing of the business process ecosystem.

Self-organizing systems can be modeled as multi-Agent systems (MAS) since they share common characteristics in that they consist of multiple autonomous systems. However, most existing MAS engineering methodologies do not fully support self-organizing systems design since they require predefined goals and agent behaviors, which is not the case in self-organizing systems. Another feature that is currently not supported for designing self-organizing MAS is the separation between the design of agent behaviors and behavior adaptation, i.e. how agents adapt their behaviors to respond upon changes. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a role modeling method, in which agent behaviors are represented as roles, to design how agents perform behavior adaptation at runtime by switching between roles. The applicability of the proposed role modeling method is evaluated in a case study of a self-organizing smart transportation system. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",agent behavior; modeling method; multi-Agent systems; role-based modeling; Self-organizing systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041695126

Objective: Our goal is to develop an approach that computes sequences of tasks such that a context-specific goal is satisfied. We apply the SMA algorithm to support run-time planning of partly structured parts of a business process in order to find an appropriate sequence of tasks. Method: We perform a literature review in order to derive the most suitable heuristic search algorithm. To support the selection and specification of tasks, we extend the CMMN metamodel. A running example is presented to show practical applicability of the approach. Results: The extension of the CMMN metamodel reflects the requirements for serializing tasks at run-time.

Our approach takes as input an exhaustive list of possible refactorings, the initial model and revised model, and generates as output a list of detected changes representing a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactorings that should maximize as much as possible the similarity between the expected revised model and the generated model after applying the refactoring sequence on the initial model. Due to the huge number of possible refactoring combinations, a heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible solutions.

User support for building data analysis workflows, however, has not progressed sufficiently: the large number of operators currently available in KDD systems and interactions between these operators complicates successful data analysis. To help Data Miners we enhanced one of the most used open source data mining tools-RapidMiner-with semantic technologies. Specifically, we first annotated all elements involved in the Data Mining (DM) process-the data, the operators, models, data mining tasks, and KDD workflows-semantically using our eProPlan modelling tool that allows to describe operators and build a task/method decomposition grammar to specify the desired workflows embedded in an ontology. Second, we enhanced RapidMiner to employ these semantic annotations to actively support data analysts. Third, we built an Intelligent Discovery Assistant, eIda, that leverages the semantic annotation as well as HTN planning to automatically support KDD process generation. We found that the use of Semantic Web approaches and technologies in the KDD domain helped us to lower the barrier to data analysis. We also found that using a generic ontology editor overwhelmed KDD-centric users. We, therefore, provided them with problem-centric extensions to Protégé. Last and most surprising, we found that our semantic modeling of the KDD domain served as a rapid prototyping approach for several hard-coded improvements of RapidMiner, namely correctness checking of workflows and quick-fixes, reinforcing the finding that even a little semantic modeling can go a long way in improving the understanding of a domain even for domain experts. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902593602

The goal is to establish a service management support framework, labelled here as SERVaaS (Servicelogy-as-a-Service), based on hybrid systems that maintain both human-oriented and machine-oriented representations of service knowledge. The human-oriented representations are enabled by agile, domain-specific service modelling methods, whereas the machine-oriented representations rely on distributed graph databases exposing knowledge graphs through RESTful APIs.

However, software testing is an expensive task, labor-intensive and time-consuming process in the software development life cycle. Every software product needs to be tested in order to make sure it achieves all of its goals and to detect any unexpected behaviour. One of the most critical features in structural testing is path testing which helps to find every possible executable path that helps to determine all faults lying within a piece of code. Any software pro-gram includes multiple entries and exit points. Testing each of these points is challenging as well as time-consuming. To reduce this complexity and time consuming, the use of ontologies might prove useful. Ontology is a technique used at one or more software lifecycle phases.

Software development has benefited from this conceptual modelling, allowing a common understanding of the concepts involved in the software process.

In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring.

More precisely, we focus on (i) the representation of clinical processes by using a temporal conceptual workflow model; (ii) the definition of ad hoc temporal constraint networks to formally represent clinical workflow cases; (iii) the definition of temporal similarity for clinical workflow cases based on the comparison of temporal constraint networks; (iv) the management of the similarity of clinical processes related to the Italian guideline for stroke prevention and management (SPREAD). Background: Clinical processes are composed by clinical activities to be done by given actors in a given order satisfying given temporal constraints. This description means that clinical processes can be seen as organizational processes, and modeled by workflow schemata. When a workflow schema represents a clinical process, its cases represent different instances derived from dealing with different patients in different situations. With respect to all the cases related to a workflow schema, each clinical case can be different with respect to its structure and to its temporal aspects. Clinical cases can be stored in clinical databases and information retrieval can be done evaluating the similarity between workflow cases. Methodology: We first describe a possible approach to the conceptual modeling of a clinical process, by using a temporally extended workflow model. Then, we define how a workflow case can be represented as a set of activities, and show how to express them through temporal constraint networks. Once we have built temporal constraint networks related to the cases to compare, we propose a similarity function able to evaluate the differences between the considered cases with respect to the order and duration of corresponding activities, and with respect to the presence/absence of some activities. Results: In this work, we propose an approach to evaluate temporal similarity between workflow cases. The proposed approach can be used (i) to query clinical databases storing clinical cases representing activities related to the management of different patients in different situations; (ii) to evaluate the quality of the service comparing the similarity between a (possibly synthetic) case, perceived as the good one with respect to a given clinical situation, and the other clinical cases; and (iii) to retrieve a particular class of cases similar to an interesting one. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To create the test cases from the source code using traditional methods is becoming very difficult and cumbersome in cluster levels. UML artifacts provide a lot of facts which help the user to navigate through the flaws from the designed documents. In this work, we propose a method for creating the test cases using sequence diagram of UML models. As the testing can be started from the design process at the beginning phase, we preferred this approach. We proposed a model to generate a sequence flow chart (SFC) from sequence diagram and then tried to convert it to message control flow graph (MCFG). By using message sequence path coverage criterion, we traversed the MCFG and the test paths are generated. The test cases from these paths are created subsequently. Finally, genetic algorithm has been applied to generate test cases and also to optimize them. The model is implemented on a case study of ATM withdrawal system. © Springer India 2015.",Genetic algorithm; Sequence diagram; Sequence flow chart,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906922324

Software testing approaches are divided into three parts i.e. code based testing, specification based testing and model based testing. In model based testing, the testing begins at design phase. So, early detection of faults can be achieved by using this approach further reducing time, cost and efforts of the developer to a large extent. In this paper we propose a technique for generating test cases using both UML sequence diagram and state chart diagram. Our approach is to convert Sequence Diagram into Sequence Graph and then to convert State Chart Diagram into State chart Graph. Finally System Testing Graph (SYTG) is formed by combining the two Graphs. From the graphs different control flow sequences also called test cases are identified and then optimized using evolutionary Algorithm, called Genetic Algorithm. Although State chart did better at revealing unit level faults and sequence diagram is better at removing integration level faults, but after integrating the two graphs, generated test cases are appropriate for system testing and to identify Error handling, correctness, pre-post condition faults, interaction, message sequence faults and scenario faults. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Genetic Algorithm; Online Voting system; Sequence Diagram; State Chart Diagram; System Testing Graph,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944064423

In model driven approach, Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a conceptual modelling approach for obligations and other features of the system in a model-driven methodology. Specialized tools interpret these models into other software artifacts such as code, test data and documentation. The generation of test cases permits the appropriate test data to be determined that have the aptitude to ascertain the requirements. This paper focuses on optimizing the test data obtained from UML activity and state chart diagrams by using Basic Genetic Algorithm (BGA). For generating the test cases, both diagrams were converted into their corresponding intermediate graphical forms namely, Activity Diagram Graph (ADG) and State Chart Diagram Graph (SCDG). Then both graphs will be combined to form a single graph called, Activity State Chart Diagram Graph (ASCDG). Both graphs were then joined to create a single graph known as the Activity State Chart Diagram Graph (ASCDG). Next, the ASCDG will be optimized using BGA to generate the test data. A case study involving a withdrawal from the automated teller machine (ATM) of a bank was employed to demonstrate the approach. The approach successfully identified defects in various ATM functions such as messaging and operation. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Test data can be generated from many sources; for example, experience of testers, source program, or software specification. Selecting a proper test data set is a decision making task. Testers have to decide what test data that they should use, and a heuristic technique is needed to solve this problem automatically. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating test data from software specifications. The selected specification is Unified Modeling Language (UML) state machine diagram. UML state machine diagram describes a system in term of state which can be changed when there is an action occurring in the system. The generated test data is a sequence of these actions. These sequences of action help testers to know how they should test the system. The quality of generated test data is measured by the number of transitions which is fired using the test data. The more transitions test data can fire, the better quality of test data is. The number of coverage transitions is also used as a feedback for a heuristic search for a better test set. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are selected for searching the best test data.

Furthermore, internal agent behavior model and interaction within the agent organizations become even more complex and hard to implement when new requirements and interactions for new agent environments such as the Semantic Web are taken into account. We believe that the use of both domain specific modeling and a Domain-specific Modeling Language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction and support a more fruitful methodology for the development of Multi-agent Systems (MASs) especially when they are working on the Semantic Web environment. Although syntax definition based on a metamodel is an essential part of a modeling language, an additional and required part would be the determination and implementation of DSML constraints that constitute the (formal) semantics which cannot be defined solely with a metamodel. Hence, in this paper, formal semantics of a MAS DSML called Semantic Web enabled Multi-agent Systems (SEA-ML) is introduced. SEA-ML is a modeling language for agent systems that specifically takes into account the interactions of semantic web agents with semantic web services. What is more, SEA-ML also supports the modeling of semantic agents from their internals to MAS perspective. Based on the defined abstract and concrete syntax definitions, we first give the formal representation of SEA-ML's semantics and then discuss its use on MAS validation. In order to define and implement semantics of SEA-ML, we employ Alloy language which is declarative and has a strong description capability originating from both relational and first-order logic in order to easily define complex structures and behaviors of these systems. Differentiating from similar contributions of other researchers on formal semantics definition for MAS development languages, SEA-ML's semantics, presented in this paper, defines both static and dynamic aspects of the interaction between software agents and semantic web services, in addition to the definition of the semantics already required for agent internals and MAS communication. Implementation with Alloy makes definition of SEA-ML's semantics to include relations and sets with a simple notation for MAS model definitions. We discuss how the automatic analysis and hence checking of SEA-ML models can be realized with the defined semantics. Design of an agent-based electronic barter system is exemplified in order to give some flavor of the use of SEA-ML's formal semantics. Lessons learned during the development of such a MAS DSML semantics are also reported in this paper. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Alloy; domain specific modeling language; Multi-agent system; semantic web; semantics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906262282

Based on teleological reasoning, each service is related to a goal which is represented by a conceptual model called an Ontology. Services are described by a functional model which relies on a core reasoning process between interacting functional components of the complex system. The process is based on Information Flow (IF) approach, where the main idea is the fusion of goal ontologies. The second level is the implementation through Multi Agent Systems (MAS).

Unfortunately, learning such global behaviours can be inaccurate and slow for systems composed of heterogeneous elements, which behave very differently, for instance as it is the case for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. Instead, to make smart decisions, such systems have to continuously refine the behaviour on a per-element basis and compose these small learning units together. However, combining and composing learned behaviours from different elements is challenging and requires domain knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to structure and combine the learned behaviours and domain knowledge together in a flexible way. In this paper we propose to weave machine learning into domain modeling. More specifically, we suggest to decompose machine learning into reusable, chainable, and independently computable small learning units, which we refer to as micro learning units. These micro learning units are modeled together with and at the same level as the domain data. We show, based on a smart grid case study, that our approach can be significantly more accurate than learning a global behaviour while the performance is fast enough to be used for live learning. © 2017 IEEE.",Cyber-physical systems; Domain modeling; Live learning; Meta modeling; Model-driven engineering; Smart grids,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040582253

Furthermore, to date, few LKBS execute on the World Wide Web. Despite this, LKBS designed for a web environment can make law more universally accessible and transparent. Tools required to facilitate the development of web based systems include a web based expert system shell, conceptual tools that allow for the identification of appropriate domains for web implementation, modeling tools for discretionary domains and architectures for virtual discourse. We present a shell called WebShell that uses two knowledge modelling techniques; decision trees for procedural type tasks and argument trees for tasks that are more discretionary. Rather than translate decision tree knowledge into rules for a conventional inference engine, we map the decision trees into sets we call sequence transition networks. These sets can readily be stored in relational database format in a way that simplifies the inference engine design. Although WebShell facilitates the deployment of LKBS in a web environment, it does not encourage negotiation and virtual discourse. An argumentation shell program, Argument Developer is presented that encourages participants in a virtual discursive community to understand each other's perspectives and reach decisions by consensus.

To perform their tasks and interact with each other, agents constitute systems called Multi-agent systems (MAS). Although agent researchers have a great effort in MAS metamodeling and model-driven MAS development, a significant deficiency exists in current studies when we consider providing a complete Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML) for MASs. We believe that a DSML increases the descriptive power of a MAS metamodel, defines the system semantics and hence supports a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs especially working on the new challenging environments such as the Semantic Web. In this paper, we introduce a new DSML for MASs with its abstract syntax, the textual concrete syntax and the interpreter mechanism. The practical use of the DSML is illustrated with a case study which considers the modeling of a multi-agent based e-barter system.

However, developing a ML project entails the effort of many ML experts who have to select and configure the appropriate algorithm to process the data to learn from, between other things. Since there exist thousands of algorithms, it becomes a time-consuming and challenging task. To this end, recently, AutoML emerged to provide mechanisms to automate parts of this process. However, most of the efforts focus on applying brute force procedures to try different algorithms or configuration and select the one which gives better results. To make a smarter and more efficient selection, a repository of knowledge is necessary. To this end, this paper proposes (1) an approach towards a common language to consolidate the current distributed knowledge sources related the algorithm selection in ML, and (2) a method to join the knowledge gathered through this language in a unified store that can be exploited later on. The preliminary evaluations of this approach allow to create a unified store colle lines to conduct. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Unfortunately, there are very few works in literature addressing the concept of traceability in multi-agent systems development methodologies. Having an incremental and iterative process, the well-known PASSI (Process for Agent Societies Specification and Implementation) methodology needs an explicit traceability in order to facilitate the understanding of the MAS under development and to better manage the changes occurring during the development process. In addition, it can lead to a requirement-based verification & validation.

After categorizing intelligence sub-characteristics based on an extensive quantitative analysis, we choose learning as the most frequent sub-characteristic of intelligence and present a process for specifying learning in intelligent systems. This process is based on Organizational Multiagent System Engineering (O-MaSE) process framework and extends this framework to cover Learning Analysis (LA) concepts. More precisely, by using O-MaSE meta-model and LA metamodels, alongside applying the process for development a system, we study the potentials of the process framework in specifying learning concepts. Based on the discovered shortcomings of the process, we propose extensions to enrich the process for specifying learning, namely for Requirements gathering, Goal modeling, Knowledge modeling and Environment specification. The applicability of the extended O-MaSE is evaluated by applying it on a Book Trading System (BTS). Based on this systematic process, software development benefits from the more specific assumptions on capabilities expected for learning, and it moves towards more sophisticated engineering practices which prevents implicit or Ad-hoc activities for developing features of intelligent. © 2015 Zarka Private Univ.

Humans are handing over more decisions to systems that provide no explanations for their judgements unless they are enabled explicitly in their design. Trust based on a program being well written and tested correctly is not appropriate for AI-based autonomous systems. Unlike traditional software, this new software increasingly exhibit emergent behaviours making it unpredictable due to unexpected situations. Self-explanation is sometimes implemented, tracking decisions to give explanations to users. A more consistent, proven approach to self-explanation would be needed for making trustable systems. The paper proposes a research agenda to define an architecture to enable self-explanation for autonomous decision-making systems. The approach will be model-driven to facilitate reuse, the rapid development of tools and suitable abstractions for demonstrating concepts. The architecture will be informed by existing research in provenance ontology and model version research. The evaluation of the architecture is expected to be done using two case studies. The first will implement self-explanation as a primary concern in the building of a system.

These techniques are useful to provide a comprehensible picture of the process as opposed to full specifications of process behavior provided by procedural modeling languages. Since many modern systems produce ""big data"" from business process executions, in previous work, a framework for the discovery of LTL-based declarative process models from streaming event data has been proposed. This framework can be used to process events online, as they occur, as a way to deal with large and complex collections of datasets that are impossible to store and process altogether. However, the proposed framework does not take into account data attributes associated with events in the log, which can otherwise provide valuable insights into the rules that govern the process. This paper makes the first proposal to close this gap by presenting a technique for discovering declarative process models from event streams that incorporates both control-flow dependencies and data conditions. Specifically, we use Hoeffding trees to incrementally discover data-aware declarative process models, which are represented as conjunctions of first-order temporal logic expressions. The proposed technique has been validated on a synthetic event log, and on a real-life log of a cancer treatment process. © 2020 IEEE.",data-aware process model; declarative process models; online process discovery,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093833236

One such formalism is domain modelling which bridges the gap between requirements expressed in natural language and analyzable and more concise domain models expressed in class diagrams. Due to the lack of modelling skills among novice modellers and time constraints in industrial projects, it is often not possible to build an accurate domain model manually. To address this challenge, we aim to develop an approach to extract domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language by combining rules based on natural language processing with machine learning. As a first step, we report on an automated and tool-supported approach with an accuracy of extracted domain models higher than existing approaches. In addition, the approach generates trace links for each model element of a domain model. The trace links enable novice modellers to execute queries on the extracted domain models to gain insights into the modelling decisions taken for improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, to evaluate our approach, we propose a novel comparison metric and discuss our experimental design.

The technique uses the UML 2.0 model of the distributed system under test, augmented with timing information, and is based on an analysis of the control flow in sequence diagrams. It yields stress test requirements that are made of specific control flow paths along with time values indicating when to trigger them. The technique considers different types of arrival patterns (e.g., periodic) for real-time events (common to DRTSs), and generates test requirements which comply with such timing constraints. Though different variants of our stress testing technique already exist (that stress different aspects of a distributed system), they share a large amount of common concepts and we therefore focus here on one variant that is designed to stress test the system at a time instant when data traffic on a network is maximal. Our technique uses genetic algorithms to find test requirements which lead to maximum possible traffic-aware stress in a system under test. Using a real-world DRTS specification, we design and implement a prototype DRTS and describe, for that particular system, how the stress test cases are derived and executed using our methodology. The stress test results indicate that the technique is significantly more effective at detecting network traffic-related faults when compared to test cases based on an operational profile. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We examine a popular cross-industry standard process for data mining, commonly known as CRISP-DM Directions, and show the potential usefulness of conceptual modeling at each stage of this process. The results are illustrated through an application to a management system for drug monitoring. Doing so demonstrates that conceptual modeling can advance machine learning by: (1) supporting the application of machine learning within organizations; (2) improving the usability of machine learning as decision tools; and (3) optimizing the performance of machine learning algorithms.

As metamodels are the cornerstone of model driven engineering and they evolve iteratively, their evolution affects the rest of artefacts involved in a development process, e.g., models or transformation rules. Therefore, co-evolution tools for models and other artefacts are indispensable. We present in this paper an intelligent approach to adapt models by means of state-based and operator-based techniques. The defined co-evolution process consists of four phases. Initially, changes between two metamodel versions are detected. After that, evolution scenario is reconstructed using logic programming method. Evolution scenario is first calculated from difference model and represented by a set of primitive evolution operations, after that it is transformed using an inference engine to include eventual composite evolution operations; from this scenario adaptation solutions are generated according to the evolution operator impact in model level. Finally, migration scenario is applied on an input model conforming to the old metamodel version to remain compliant with its metamodel.

How to prevent, detect, and correct errors as early as possible in the modeling process by verifying the correctness of fuzzy UML models is desirable. But it is difficult to manually verify the correctness of the models. Thanks to the effective reasoning service of fuzzy Description Logics (DLs), they are considered as natural candidates for supporting the verification of fuzzy UML models. In this paper we propose a complete and practical approach for verifying fuzzy UML models with fuzzy DLs. In detail, we first propose an approach for transforming a fuzzy UML model into a fuzzy DL knowledge base. Then we further reduce the verification tasks of the fuzzy UML model to reasoning problems of the transformed fuzzy DL knowledge base. Also, the correctness of the approach is proved, and a running example is provided to explain the approach in detail. Final we implemented a prototype that can transform fuzzy UML models into fuzzy DL knowledge bases. Case studies show that the proposed approach is feasible and the prototype translator actually works. By means of our approach and tool, the transformed fuzzy DL knowledge base and reasoning tasks can be input into the existing fuzzy DL reasoners, and the reasoning results reported by the reasoners can be passed back to the designer to improve the quality of the fuzzy UML model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Fuzzy Description Logic; Fuzzy UML model; Reasoning; Transformation; Verification,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052928460

In respect to the relation with users, they should be non-obtrusive, context aware, personalized, adaptive and anticipatory. Reliable way to achieve these main features is the choice of appropriate development approach that will ensure the reusability, portability, scalability and interoperability of ambient intelligence applications. The model driven development is a promising approach for development of different software applications using models at different levels of abstraction and applying model transformation to code generation. In this paper an extension to the traditional model driven development approach is suggested based on model driven architecture and compositional models as core elements for automation of expert activities, enabling the context-awareness of application. The ambient intelligence systems are represented as layer-based multi agent systems that enable the division of system elements into levels, reduce the coupling between modules and facilitates abstractions as well as the distributions of responsibilities.

The home is considered a distributed system, it is composed of a set of elements that are geographically distributed and in permanent interaction.

The logics-based representation emphasizes the meaning of concepts and properties, i.e., their semantics. The modeler in the object-oriented paradigm also takes into account the pragmatics, i.e., how the classes are used, by whom, and why. To enable a comprehensive use of logics-based representations in object-oriented software systems, a seamless integration of the two paradigms is needed. However, the pragmatic issues of using logic-based knowledge in object-oriented software applications has yet not been considered sufficiently. Rather, the pragmatic issues that arise in using an ontology, e.g., which classes to instantiate in which order, remains a task to be carefully considered by the application developer.

Relying on a Gibsonian vision of the world to represent, our assumption is that objects naturally give suggestions on how they can be used. From an ontological point of view, this leads to the problem of having different representations of identical objects depending on the context and the involved agents, creating a more realistic multi-diffensional object space to be formally defined. While avoiding to represent purely subjective views, the main issue that needs to be faced is how to manage the highest complexity with the minimum resource requirements. More in detail, we extend the idea of ontologies taking into account the subjectivity of the agents that are involved in the interaction. Instead of duplicating objects, according to the interaction, the ontology changes its aspect, fitting the specific situations that take place. We propose the centerpieces of the idea as well as suggestions of applications that such approach can have in several domains, ranging from Natural Language Processing techniques and Ontology Alignment to User Modeling and Social Networks.

The proposed solution allows for a simple design of the decision support systems and the reduction of time and costs of development. The authors use the inductive logic programming framework to learn these transformation rules from examples of previous projects.

Rule-based DSE [10,14,18] aims to find such candidates that are reachable from an initial model by applying a sequence of exploration rules. Solving a rule-based DSE problem is a difficult challenge due to the inherently dynamic nature of the problem. In the current paper, we propose to integrate multi-objective optimization techniques by using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA) to drive rule-based design space exploration. For this purpose, finite populations of the most promising design candidates are maintained wrt. different optimization criteria. In our context, individuals of a generation are defined as a sequence of rule applications leading from an initial model to a candidate model. Populations evolve by mutation and crossover operations which manipulate (change, extend or combine) rule execution sequences to yield new individuals. Our multi-objective optimization approach for rule-based DSE is domain independent and it is automated by tooling built on the Eclipse framework. The main added value is to seamlessly lift multi-objective optimization techniques to the exploration process preserving both domain independence and a high-level of abstraction. Design candidates will still be represented as models and the evolution of these models as rule execution sequences. Constraints are captured by model queries while objectives can be derived both from models or rule applications. © 2014 ACM.",Model-driven engineering; Multi-objective optimization; Rule-based design space exploration,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908611671

Different kinds of models can be settled to solve different problems, such as physical models, mathematical models, figurai models etc. The main shortcoming of such traditional models is that they treat the members of the system as ones without aims, preferences and activities. Agent technology provides a new idea and methodology for modeling. Agent-based modeling pays more attention to the behavior and the interaction of the individuals in the systems, and the macroscopic characteristics of the system are the interactive result of all the individuals. In this paper, the agent-based modeling method is applied to the urban traffic simulation system. The process of the modeling is discussed, and a prototype of a simulation system is programmed. A reinforcement learning control method is tested on the prototype to verify the effectiveness of the modeling method proposed in this paper.",Agent; Modeling; Simulation; Traffic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43549122358

Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations.

Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers and urban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and their environment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible. Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues: there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code; their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compare works that use different models and tools. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven development of these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language that supports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS: people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network of sensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed that operates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generate specifications compliant with that language, and a code generator to produce code from them using platform specifications. There are also guidelines to help researchers in the application of this infrastructure.

This paper describes an approach to black-box test-generation in which an AI (artificial intelligence) planner is used to generate test cases from test objectives derived from UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagrams. The UML Class Diagrams are conceptual models of the systems under test. They differ from traditional design and requirements models in that they include information pertinent to test case generation. From these models, test objectives and a domain theory are: • obtained, • transformed to planner representations, and • input to the planner. The planner uses the problem description to generate a test suite that satisfies the UML-derived test objectives.

The main idea of this tool is to combine colored timed Petri nets with the queueing systems, and it aims to make simulation over the model more efficient. Due to the wide acceptance of priority rules in the wafer manufacturing industry, we also proposed a mechanism to realize priority rules in the QCPN models. Since it is known that no single rule can dominate in any circumstance, we proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal combination of a number of priority rules based on the status and performance measures of the fab. Our approach can be considered as taking the advantage of the lot execution sequence generated by priority rules to guide the search. This approach can reduce the solution space and help us find the good solution more quickly. In addition, the QCPN-based GA scheduler can greatly reduce the computation time so that this GA scheduler can meet the need for a rapidly changing environment. Note to Practitioners-Performance evaluation and scheduling are two functions required by fab managers and engineers. This paper proposed a tool which consists of a simulator and a scheduler. By connecting to the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and providing the scheduling rules, we can see how the fab runs virtually with the simulator. General information such as throughput and average cycle time and specific information like lot activity history can be obtained. This can be used for decision making, delivery prediction, bottleneck seeking, and testing of newly developed heurisitcs. The implementation cost is only on data communication between the MES and the simulator and the incorporation of rule modules. The scheduler, which takes the simulator as the performance evaluation module, can generate the suitable scheduling rule based on the current fab status, preference of performance criteria, and rule candidates. There is almost no extra cost after the simulator is connected to the MES. The scheduler can be easily made faster by common parallelization techniques. © 2006 IEEE.",Genetic algorithms (GAs); Petri nets; Queueing systems; Semiconductor manufacturing scheduling,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746441144

This makes the traffic they comprise challenging for automated systems. The information traditionally considered (e.g., streets, and obstacle positions and speeds) is not enough to build suitable models of the environment. The required explanatory and anticipation capabilities need additional information to improve them. Social aspects (e.g., goal of the displacement, companion, or available time) should be considered, as they have a strong influence on how people move and interact with the environment. This paper presents the Social-Aware Driver Assistance System (SADAS) approach to integrate this information into traffic systems. It relies on a domain-specific modelling language for social contexts and their changes. Specifications compliant with it describe social and system information, their links, and how to process them. Traffic social properties are the formalization within the language of relevant knowledge extracted from literature to interpret information. A multi-agent system architecture manages these specifications and additional processing resources. A SADAS can be connected to other parts of traffic systems by means of subscription-notification mechanisms. The case study to illustrate the approach applies social knowledge to predict people’s movements. It considers a distributed system for obstacle detection and tracking, and the intelligent management of traffic signals. © 2019 by the authors.
